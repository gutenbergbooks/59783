    <h2>PREFACE</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">During</span> the period when the newspapers were publishing daily reports
    of the progress of the work in Tutankhamen’s tomb and Mr Harry
    Burton’s photographs, which gave us so vivid an impression of the
    objects that were being found, I wrote for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> a
    series of articles discussing the wider significance of the startling
    discoveries. They did not describe the tomb itself or the wonderful
    collection of funerary equipment, but were merely a general commentary
    on the meaning of the information being given by the reporters from the
    Theban necropolis. Nor was any attempt made to collect the few facts
    concerning Tutankhamen himself, or even to discuss the events of his
    time. The exploration of the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings, for
    which the late Lord Carnarvon and Mr Howard Carter were responsible,
    had brought to light the tomb of the youthful nonentity Tutankhamen,
    which sheds a dazzling searchlight on one particular phase of the
    history of civiliza<span class="pagenum" >10</span>tion thirty centuries ago. What I set out to
    attempt was to interpret the deeper meaning of those Egyptian beliefs
    which found such brilliant expression in the luxuriously extravagant
    equipment of his tomb.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been urged to collect these articles into the more convenient
    form of this little book. As they were merely comments on the
    descriptions of the actual tomb and its contents the separate issue
    of these topical and ephemeral notes seemed at first to lack any
    justification, but I have received so many requests for information and
    guidance that I thought it might serve some useful purpose to redraft
    my articles and give such bibliographical references as would help the
    general reader to understand the results that have so far been attained
    and to appreciate the value of the more important discoveries that next
    season’s work will certainly reveal.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    I have used the pharaoh’s name “Tutankhamen” as the title of this book
    merely as a label to suggest the circumstance that called it into
    being. But I have written an introductory chapter to give an account of
    what is known of him and his times.

    <h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> only accurate and reliable account that has ever been given
    of the Egyptian funerary practices and their significance is Dr
    Alan Gardiner’s introductory memoir on <i>The Tomb of Amenemhēt</i>
    (illustrated by Nina de Garis Davies) which was published in 1915 under
    the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society).
  </p>

  <p>
    Dr Gardiner describes the actual condition of affairs found in a
    private Theban tomb of the eighteenth dynasty (in the reign of Thothmes
    III, about a century earlier than Tutankhamen); and in the light of his
    intimate knowledge and understanding of the literature of the period,
    he interprets the meaning of the arrangement of the tomb and especially
    of the scenes and inscriptions sculptured and painted upon the walls,
    which Mrs de Garis Davies has reproduced with such skill and accuracy.
    This unique work is indispensable to anyone who wants to read what the
    ancient Egyptians themselves actually wrote to express their beliefs
    or<span class="pagenum" >12</span> interpret their customs. Professor James H. Breasted’s <i>
      History
      of Egypt
    </i> and <i>Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt</i>
    are the best guides to a knowledge of the history and religion of
    ancient Egypt. The late Sir Gaston Maspero’s <i>Egyptian Art</i> (London,
    1913) contains a great deal of information directly relevant to the
    interpretation of objects in Tutankhamen’s tomb. But Mr Burton’s
    photographs of Tutankhamen’s funerary equipment give a new interest
    and value to Birch’s edition of Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s <i>
      The Manners
      and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians
    </i> (London, 1878), for many of the
    objects and funeral scenes depicted in that remarkable book enable us
    to form a mental picture of the Valley of the Tombs as the funeral of
    Tutankhamen wound its way to the place where Mr Howard Carter has just
    brought to light so many articles closely analogous to those depicted
    in Birch’s and Wilkinson’s book.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    All the information at present available concerning the life of
    Tutankhamen and Horemheb, his successor once removed, was collected
    and published (in 1912) by the late Sir Gaston Maspero,
    <i>The Tombs of Harmhabi<span class="pagenum" >13</span>
    and Touatânkhamanou</i> (<i>Theodore M. Davis’ Excavations</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The other volumes of reports published by Mr Theodore Davis are
    valuable for reference and comparison in studying the results of the
    exploration of Tutankhamen’s tomb. The two volumes, <i>The Tomb of Iouiya
    and Touiyou</i> (1907) and <i>The Tomb of Queen Tiyi</i> (1910) are specially
    important, and relevant to the discoveries in Tutankhamen’s tomb. Mr
    Arthur Weigall’s book <i>The Life and Times of Akhnaton</i> gives a popular
    and romantic picture of his conception of the history of the times of
    Tutankhamen and his father-in-law.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Never</span> before in the history of archæological inquiry has any event
    excited such immediate and world-wide interest as Mr Howard Carter’s
    discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb in November 1922. Very little is known
    as yet of the king himself, but twelve months hence no doubt his
    mummy will give up its secrets and perhaps the story of his life will
    be revealed. But at the moment he is supposed to have been merely a
    colourless youth, who reigned for a few years only, and achieved such
    notoriety as is associated with his name by virtue of weakness rather
    than strength of character. For his religious and political opinions
    seem to have been as plastic as those of the famous Vicar of Bray,
    adapting themselves with facility to his changing environment. The
    objects so far found in his tomb do not add very materially to our
    knowledge of history.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >16</span></p>

  <p>
    Yet, in spite of the unimportance of Tutankhamen himself and the
    comparative lack of new historical data, the world-wide interest the
    discovery has evoked is amply warranted by the new appreciation of
    historical values it affords.
  </p>

  <p>
    It gives us a new revelation of the wealth and luxury of Egyptian
    civilization during its most magnificent period. The value of the
    gold and precious objects far surpasses that of any hoard previously
    recovered from ancient times. Judged merely by its quantity the
    collection of furniture is the most wonderful ever found; and everyone
    who has examined the individual pieces agrees that in beauty of design
    and perfection of craftsmanship Tutankhamen’s funerary equipment is
    indeed a new revelation of the ancient Egyptians’ artistic feeling and
    technical skill, far surpassing anything known before.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fact that the tomb of so insignificant a personage as Tutankhamen
    was equipped with such lavish magnificence adds to the importance of
    the discovery. For if a youthful nonentity who reigned no more than
    six or seven years in one of the leanest phases of Egypt’s history
    had all this wealth poured into his tomb, one’s imagination tries in
    vain<span class="pagenum" >17</span>
    to picture the funerary equipment of the famous and longer-lived
    pharaohs, such as Thothmes III, who established the Egyptian Empire
    in Asia and could command the tribute of the then civilized world, or
    Amenhotep III, under whom the sovereign power in Egypt attained its
    culmination, and luxury and ostentation their fullest expression. Or
    again what riches must have been poured into the vast tombs of Seti
    I and Rameses II, the powerful pharaohs who recovered for a time the
    Egyptian dominion in Asia which Akhenaton and his sons-in-law had lost?
    A thousand years before Christ the desolate Valley of the Tombs of the
    Kings must have had buried in its recesses the vastest collection of
    gold and precious furniture that perhaps was ever collected in one spot
    in the history of the world. For these reasons alone there is ample
    justification for the world-wide interest in the discovery which will
    always be associated with the names of Lord Carnarvon and Mr Howard
    Carter.
  </p>

  <p>
    But apart from its interest as an artistic revelation and the intrinsic
    value of the objects found the discovery is important for other
    reasons. The dazzling display of skill and luxury has forced the
    scholar and the man in the<span class="pagenum" >18</span>
    street to recognize in some measure the
    vastness of the achievements of ancient Egyptian civilization and to
    ask themselves whether this vigorous and highly developed culture could
    have failed to exert a much more profound influence upon its neighbours
    than is generally admitted. When it is recalled that Egypt herself
    devised the ships and developed the seamanship which created the chief
    bond of union with Syria and Crete, East Africa and Arabia, the Persian
    Gulf and beyond, we should be in a better position to realize the plain
    meaning of the evidence that points to Egypt as the dominating factor
    in shaping the nascent civilization of the world. The wide interest in
    the revelation of Egypt’s achievements more than thirty centuries ago
    should prepare men’s minds impartially to study the vast significance
    of the facts thus displayed by Mr Howard Carter’s investigations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides revealing the wonderful equipment of a royal tomb the discovery
    of Tutankhamen’s tomb enables us to examine many objects and articles
    of funerary equipment hitherto known to us only in pictures. This
    makes it possible for us not only to study and appreciate the nature
    of the things themselves, but also to acquire new confidence in the
    accuracy and the<span class="pagenum" >19</span>
    reality of the scenes and the objects depicted upon
    the walls of the tombs and the pictures inscribed on papyri. Many of
    the illustrations that have long been familiar to us in the old books
    of Belzoni, Lepsius, Rosellini, and Wilkinson, have acquired a new
    meaning and a new reality from the discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb.
    Moreover, when the examination of the tomb is completed, and we learn
    something of the mummy, the king’s distinctive features, his age, and
    his ailments, we shall be able to read the history of his time more
    clearly, and perhaps be able to appreciate the deeper significance of
    one of the most piquant phases in the history of civilization.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time of Tutankhamen the great peoples that had built up
    civilization were losing their dominant position. Egypt’s power was
    showing definite signs of weakness, which were intensified rather than
    caused solely by the pacifist policy of Akhenaton and his sons-in-law.
    For even the vigorous rule of the powerful pharaohs of the nineteenth
    dynasty merely revived Egyptian power for a time before its final
    collapse. Fifty years before Tutankhamen, the Palace of Knossos had
    been destroyed in Crete, marking the downfall of the great pioneer
    of Mediterranean civilization<span class="pagenum" >20</span>
    to which Greece and Europe as a whole
    became heir. Babylonia also had reached the limits of her influence:
    and the weakening of these three earliest great powers allowed the
    Hittites and the Assyrians to struggle the one with the other for
    supremacy, crushing out such states as that of the Mitanni, and by
    exhausting themselves, so prepared the way for the eventual incursion
    of Persia into the Mediterranean area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another reason why the sudden weakening of Egyptian influence in Asia
    under Akhenaton and Tutankhamen is so important an event in the history
    of civilization is because it occurred at a time when the literature of
    the Jews was becoming crystallized in the shape that was destined to
    exert so tremendous an influence upon the history of belief and social
    practice. If Egyptian rule had not been weakened at this particular
    time and Palestine had not been subjected to the disturbing influences
    of Syrian, Hittite, and Assyrian interference, the Old Testament would
    not have been composed in the atmosphere of strife that gives it its
    distinctive tone and seems to us to-day unduly to exalt the importance
    of warfare and the value of military courage.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if the weakness of Akhenaton and<span class="pagenum" >21</span>
    Tutankhamen contributed in some
    measure to the facilitation of strife in Palestine and its reaction
    upon the sacred literature of the world, the times in which these
    events occurred were pregnant with new trends in the development
    of civilization for which these weak kinglets could not be held
    responsible. Aryan-speaking people had recently made their appearance
    on the stage of history for the first time, in Asia Minor and around
    the head waters of the Euphrates in Syria, and in the approaching
    disruption of the powers of Western Asia, the influence of these people
    of Indo-European speech was destined to make itself obtrusive in Persia
    and India and exert a growing influence upon religious beliefs and
    social practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    But simultaneously with these events of far-reaching significance in
    Asia, the people of Europe also first intruded upon the attention
    of Egypt, and revealed the fact that a new orientation of political
    influence was in preparation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between Asia and Europe the disturbances in the Levant played some
    part in launching upon their world-wide career of exploitation the
    persistent trading people we know as Phœnicians, who were responsible
    for the rapid diffusion of the elements of civilization during
    several centuries from Tutankhamen’s time onward. At the moment it is
    the fashion to scoff at the Phœnicians and their works: but no one who
    seriously studies the evidence relating to their achievements is likely
    to be deceived by this pose. For there is no doubt these people did
    fulfil the rôle attributed to them in the Book of Ezekiel.

  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum" >23</span>
    The period which is so brilliantly illuminated by the discovery of
    Tutankhamen’s tomb is thus perhaps the most critical period in the
    whole history of civilization. A new era was dawning and every scrap of
    information that sheds any light upon the circumstances of this fateful
    time is of tremendous interest to us in understanding the civilization
    under which we ourselves are living.

    <h2>CHAPTER II<br />
      <span class="subhead">EXPLORATION OF THE THEBAN TOMBS OF THE KINGS</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> work of modern exploration of the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings
    can be said to have begun in 1819 when the traveller Belzoni opened and
    wrote a description of the tomb of Seti I. In 1881 the discovery was
    made of a collection of royal mummies, many of which had been buried
    about thirty centuries ago in the Valley of the Tombs, and had been
    removed about 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and hidden in a chamber in the great
    cliff (behind Deir el Bahari) that faces the Nile across the Theban
    plain. This stimulated renewed interest in the famous necropolis, but
    it was not until 1898 that the work of exploration there was rewarded
    by the discovery of the tomb of Amenhotep II containing the mummy of
    that pharaoh himself—the only king’s mummy ever found in his own tomb
    before the discovery of Tutankhamen’s, in which it is confidently
    <span class="pagenum" >25</span>
    believed the mummy is present and undisturbed, an unprecedented
    circumstance which will make the investigations next winter peculiarly
    important. For the mummy of Amenhotep II had been badly plundered like
    all those discovered before or since until the opening of Tutankhamen’s
    burial chamber made it practically certain that in it will be revealed
    for the first time to modern men the undisturbed tomb of an ancient
    Egyptian king.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Mr Howard Carter was appointed Chief Inspector of Antiquities for
    Upper Egypt his chief function was to safeguard the antiquities in the
    Thebaid. The Egyptian Government through its Archæological Committee
    has been in the habit (until the present year, when the wise rule that
    encouraged serious archæological exploration is being revoked) of
    granting to archæologists whose competence was regarded as satisfactory
    permission to excavate on ancient sites, and the Antiquities Department
    allowed such workers to take out of the country half the antiquities
    brought to light. But the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings was
    excluded from the operation of this rule, because the Antiquities
    Department reserved for itself a site of such historical importance.
    Hence when Mr Howard Carter<span class="pagenum" >26</span>
    took charge of the Theban inspectorate
    he was in a serious dilemma. The deserted Valley of the Tombs of the
    Kings, in the hidden depths of which was hoarded the remains of the
    vastest collection of valuable antiquities ever assembled, was in his
    charge, and alongside it the modern population of Luxor and Sheikh
    abd-el-Gournah, the most skilful and persistent group of tomb-robbers
    who had been habituated to the practice of this craft for many
    centuries. Yet he could not solve the difficulty by the most efficient
    form of control, that is, by carrying on excavations there, because the
    Antiquities Department had no funds for such work and, for the reasons
    already given, private excavators were not allowed to work in the
    Valley of the Tombs. Mr Carter was fortunate in being able to find a
    solution of the problem that evaded all these difficulties. Mr Theodore
    M. Davis, of Newport, Rhode Island, who was visiting Egypt as a tourist
    in the winter 1902-1903, was persuaded to place at the disposal of the
    Department of Antiquities the funds for exploration in the Valley of
    the Tombs without claiming any reward beyond the kudos which his action
    brought. Hence in 1903 Mr Howard Carter began excavating in the Valley
    at Mr Davis’s<span class="pagenum" >27</span>
    expense and discovered the tomb of Thothmes IV. The
    mummy of this pharaoh, which had been found in 1898 by M. Loret in the
    tomb of Amenhotep II, was unwrapped after its original tomb was found;
    and at Mr Carter’s suggestion, M. Maspero asked me to investigate it.
    Mr Davis published a magnificent volume giving a report of the work
    in the tomb and the results of the investigation of the mummy. In the
    following years the expedition financed by Mr Davis found six other
    important inscribed tombs, those of Queen Hatshepsut, Yuaa and Tuaa
    (the parents of Queen Tiy), King Siptah, Prince Mentuherkhepshef, King
    Akhenaton and King Horemheb, and nine uninscribed tombs, one of which
    contained the beautiful gold jewellery of Queen Tausret and of her
    second husband Seti II, and another the pieces of inscribed gold plate
    stolen during the reign of Horemheb from the tombs of Kings Tutankhamen
    and Ay.
  </p>

    <div class="captionc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Mummy of Thothmes IV.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >28</span>
    Before the war Mr Davis had completed his share of the work. He
    imagined that he had found the tomb of Tutankhamen, and in the preface
    of the last of his series of magnificent reports he makes the remark:
    “I fear that the Valley of the Tombs is now exhausted.” But it is a
    fortunate thing that Mr Howard Carter did not share this idea. After
    the war the late Lord Carnarvon, with whom Mr Howard Carter had been
    working since 1907, applied to the Antiquities Department, and
    <span class="pagenum" >29</span> was
    granted a concession to be allowed to continue in the Valley of the
    Tombs the work which the late Mr Theodore Davis had abandoned. The work
    carried out by Lord Carnarvon and Mr Howard Carter before they took
    over Mr Davis’s concession led to some important discoveries, the chief
    results of which were published in 1912, in a magnificent volume
    <i>Five Years’ Exploration at Thebes</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings they carried out real and
    thorough exploration, as no previous workers had done. Instead of
    making mere exploratory openings into the masses of rubble they
    began systematically to clear the ground, moving vast quantities of
    material—they are said to have moved as much as 200,000 tons—in the
    process. In spite of the discouragement of doing work of so exhaustive
    and expensive a kind with no further reward than a few unimportant
    pots, they pressed on, until on 5th November 1922 their indomitable
    persistence was rewarded with the most wonderful discovery ever made in
    the history of archæological investigation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The day before he left London last January to return to Egypt Lord
    Carnarvon gave this account of the discovery. In the famous tomb of the
    Vizier Rekhmara no burial shaft could<span class="pagenum" >30</span>
    be found, and after searching
    for it near the tomb-building it was decided to try in the Valley of
    the Tombs. While cleaning the floor of the valley for this purpose,
    Mr Carter found a step cut in the rock and after further clearance he
    found a wall in the cement upon which was impressed the seal of the
    Royal Necropolis. Further examination revealed the presence of a tomb
    that had been entered soon after the burial. It bore the cartouche of
    the King Tutankhamen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of the amazing treasures that have so far been discovered in
    the tomb has been told in the daily press day by day from November 1922
    until April 1923, and Mr Harry Burton’s photographs have given us a
    realistic idea of their appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plan of the tomb presents a marked contrast to the more familiar
    Theban burial places; but it becomes more intelligible when it is
    compared with those which were made at the heretic king’s capital
    during the time of Akhenaton.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the four chambers in the tomb only one has up to now so far been
    examined, and when the inventory comes to be made of the annexe,
    which is now packed with furniture, and the room leading out of the
    burial chamber, the<span class="pagenum" >31</span>
    largest and most wonderful collection of ancient
    furniture that has ever been made will be revealed.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the most marvellous revelations of all await the investigator
    next season when the shrines in the burial chamber are opened and the
    sarcophagus and the coffins within it are made to reveal to us how a
    royal mummy was prepared for its eternal home.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plan of the tomb of Rameses IV, made more than two centuries
    later than the time of Tutankhamen, is the only evidence we have of
    the arrangement of the coffins within the shrines; but the coffins
    of Yuaa and Tuaa, the great-grandparents of Tutankhamen’s wife, and
    especially the wonderful coffin made for Akhenaton, his father-in-law,
    have prepared us for what we are to find next winter. But the artistic
    inspiration revealed in the design of Tutankhamen’s funerary furniture
    and the craftsmanship are so vastly superior to those displayed in
    other tombs that we cannot predict what gems of art will be found when
    the inner coffins are exposed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the mummy itself we can predict the success of the embalmer’s
    efforts, because the art of preserving the body was at its best in the
    period from Amenhotep II until Rameses II, but some very interesting
    points in the technique of embalming remain to be discovered. In the
    case of Amenhotep III, the latest mummy of the eighteenth dynasty so
    far examined, the new procedure for stuffing packing material under the
    skin was introduced for the first time. In the nineteenth and twentieth
    dynasties it was completely given up, only to be readopted in the
    twenty-first dynasty. It will be interesting to discover whether or not
    this procedure was still in vogue at the time of Tutankhamen.

      <span class="subhead">TUTANKHAMEN</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">During</span> the course of the excavations in the Valley of the Tombs of the
    Kings made on behalf of the late Mr Theodore M. Davis in the years
    1906 and 1907, a series of objects were discovered bearing the name of
    Tutankhamen. In all probability they were stolen from his tomb during
    the reign of Horemheb, only a few years after the pharaoh was buried.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under a large rock, found tilted on one side near the foot of a high
    hill, the late Mr Edward Ayrton, who was in charge of Mr Davis’s
    Exploration in 1906, found a beautiful blue glaze cup bearing the
    cartouche of Tutankhamen. In the following year, when the late Mr E.
    Harold Jones was superintending the work, a rock-cut chamber was found;
    and as it contained so many objects bearing the name of Tutankhamen
    it was assumed by Mr Davis that he had discovered that king’s tomb.
    Hence the<span class="pagenum" >36</span>
    volume published in 1912 giving an account of the work of
    1906, 1907, and 1908 (during the last of which the tomb of Horemheb
    was found on the south side of the chamber already mentioned) was
    entitled <i>The Tombs of Harmhabi</i> [Horemheb] <i>and Touatânkhamanou</i>
    [Tutankhamen] (Theodore M. Davis’ Excavations: Bibân el Molük), and
    the late Sir Gaston Maspero gave accounts of all that was then known
    of the lives of both Horemheb and Tutankhamen. It is only right to add
    that Sir Gaston Maspero did not regard the chamber opened by Mr Harold
    Jones as the tomb of Tutankhamen. For in the closing paragraph of his
    report on the scanty information we have of Tutankhamen’s life and
    achievements, he states: “I suppose his tomb was in the Western Valley,
    somewhere between or near Amenôthes III [Amenhotep III, the last
    royal mummy known to have been buried at Thebes before Tutankhamen,
    because Akhenaton and Smenkhara were buried at El Amarna, and removed
    to Thebes later] and Aiya [Ay, the successor of Tutankhamen]: when
    the reaction against Atonu and his followers was complete, his mummy
    and his furniture were taken to a hiding-place, as those of Tiyi and
    Khuniatonu had been,<span class="pagenum" >37</span>
    probably under Harmhabi, and there Davis found
    what remained of it after so many transfers and plunders. But this also
    is a mere hypothesis, the truth of which we have no means of proving or
    disproving as yet.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Sir Gaston was right in assuming that the chamber discovered
    in 1907 was not Tutankhamen’s tomb, his hypothesis that the latter
    might have been in the neighbourhood of his predecessor (Amenhotep III)
    and his successor (Ay) has been shown by Mr Howard Carter’s recent
    discovery not to be true. The chamber seems to have been nothing more
    than a safe (perhaps cut out by the workmen who were making a tomb for
    Horemheb) in which plunderers of the tombs of Tutankhamen and Ay hid
    their spoil. Why they were unable to rescue all the gold they stole
    and so hid away is not apparent. The chamber was buried at a depth of
    25 feet and was almost filled with mud, which had been swept into it
    by the rain of many centuries. In this room was found a broken box
    containing several pieces of gold stamped with the names of Tutankhamen
    and his wife Ankhsenamen, and others bearing the name of his successor
    called the King’s Father-in-law Ay and his wife Tiy, but without any
    title or prenomen. In the mud was found the
    <span class="pagenum" >38</span> very beautiful statuette
    made of fine translucent aragonite commonly called “alabaster.” Apart
    from its value as a wonderful work of art this figure is interesting
    as the broad scarf around the loins is tied in the Syrian fashion.
    Unfortunately there is no inscription on it. M. Daressy makes the
    tentative suggestion that it may represent Ay before his succession to
    the throne.
  </p>

  <p>
    When it is recalled that in the recently discovered tomb parts of the
    gold plating were found to have been torn off the throne and other
    pieces of furniture brought to light by Lord Carnarvon’s expedition, it
    is interesting to note that the inscribed sheets of gold found in 1908
    represent scenes of Tutankhamen’s triumphs and captured prisoners such
    as would have adorned the tomb furniture that has been found mutilated.
    Other pieces of gold represent similar scenes from furniture plundered
    from the tomb of Tutankhamen’s successor Ay.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few days after the discovery of the chamber containing these stolen
    objects a pit was found, some distance away from it, in which there
    were large earthenware pots containing debris from a tomb, such as
    wreaths of leaves and flowers and small bags of powdered substance.
    The cover of one of these jars was broken and
    <span class="pagenum" >39</span> wrapped around it was a
    piece of linen bearing an inscription in ink which refers to the sixth
    year of Tutankhamen’s reign.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this volume, as I have already mentioned, the late Sir Gaston
    Maspero collected together the few scraps of information available in
    1912 with reference to the life and reign of Tutankhamen.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the British Museum there are two models of lions sculptured from
    red granite, one of which was made at the instigation of Amenhotep
    III for a temple in the Soudan. The other one may have been carved
    for Tutankhamen, who claims that he “repaired the monuments of his
    father Amenhotep.” For nearly a century scholars have been discussing
    the question whether the use of the word “father” was intended to
    refer to his parentage, whether, in fact, Tutankhamen was a brother
    or half-brother of his father-in-law the heretic king Akhenaton,
    or whether the word was used simply as a term of respect for his
    predecessor. The problem still remains unsolved, for Tutankhamen’s
    elevation to the throne was due to his marriage with the daughter of
    Akhenaton, the customary method in ancient Egypt for establishing a
    right to the kingship.

  <p>
    At the time of his marriage and succession he belonged to the Aton
    faith, which his father-in-law had established, and his name was
    Tutankhaton. But as soon as Akhenaton died, Tutankhaton and his wife
    Ankhsenpaaton abandoned the heresy and returned to the orthodox faith
    of Amen. As a token of their conversion they changed their names
    to Tutankhamen and Ankhsenamen and left Akhenaton’s capital for
    Thebes, the headquarters of the priesthood of Amen, who no doubt were
    responsible for Tutankhamen’s sudden return to the old religion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The little information we possess of his reign is derived mainly
    from the inscriptions upon the Theban temples restored by him after
    his return to the orthodox faith, though many of these records are
    palimpsests, for Horemheb replaced Tutankhamen’s name on most of them.
    The two other chief sources of information are: (<i>a</i>) the piece of
    linen found in 1907, which is the only certain evidence that he reigned
    as long as six years; and (<i>b</i>) a remarkably interesting series of
    wall-pictures in the tombs of Huy at Kurnet (Murrai), which afford
    the only record we have of Tutankhamen’s relations with Ethiopia and
    Asia. These pictures are among the most familiar records of ancient
    Egyptian life, having been used by Champollion, Lepsius, Brugsch and
    Piehl, and the inscriptions describing the scenes have been translated

    <h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
      <span class="subhead">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DISCOVERY</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">When</span> the eyes of all the world are focussed on the tomb of Tutankhamen
    and the fresh revelation it affords of the superb achievements of
    the ancient Egyptians in the arts and crafts, it is worth while to
    consider how this new discovery is likely to affect our attitude to
    the history of civilization and to promote a fuller recognition of the
    human motives that found expression in its creation and development.
    Apart from the demonstration it affords of the fabulous wealth that was
    hidden away more than thirty centuries ago in the Valley of the Tombs
    of the Kings, the new discovery appeals as an æsthetic revelation of
    dazzling brilliance rather than as an addition to our knowledge. So far
    its effect has been to force the scholar and the man in the street to
    take an interest in the civilization that was capable of producing such
    perfect works of art, and to ask themselves whether this precocious
    culture was really so exotic as it is commonly supposed
    <span class="pagenum" >45</span> to have been,
    or whether, on the contrary, such achievements on the very threshold of
    a yet unenlightened Europe did not exert a far greater influence than
    it is usual to accord them.
  </p>

  <p>
    But at present we are concerned simply in considering what is the
    significance of the discoveries so far made; the furniture, which has
    never been surpassed in the perfection of its workmanship and exquisite
    decoration; linen of a fineness and a beauty of texture that have never
    been excelled; carved alabaster vases such as the world has never seen
    before; and statues that afford some justification for the ancient
    belief that they were, in truth, “living images.” What is the meaning
    of all this lavish display of skill and beauty? Why was so much wealth
    poured into the hidden recesses of this desolate ravine, and the most
    exquisite products of the world’s achievement in the arts and crafts
    buried out of sight in this strange necropolis? The true answers
    to these questions reveal the motive force that brought about the
    development of civilization and made Egypt the pioneer in its creation.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Embalming and Immortality</i></h3>

  <p>
    All these elaborate preparations, the laborious and costly process of
    hewing the tomb out of<span class="pagenum" >46</span>
    the solid rock and furnishing it with such
    magnificence, were made because the ancient Egyptians believed that
    the king’s body to be housed in it had been made imperishable. They
    imagined that when the body was embalmed the continuation of the
    king’s existence had been assured. Hence they provided him with food
    and raiment, the furniture and amulets, the jewels and the unguents,
    and other luxuries which he had been accustomed to enjoy, before he
    was taken to his “eternal house” in the desolate Valley of the Tombs.
    There can be no doubt that in the early days of Egyptian history this
    naïve belief was regarded in all seriousness as the simple truth. In
    fact, the thoroughness with which at first the Egyptians gave concrete
    expression to their faith in making material provision for every want
    that the deceased might experience could only have been inspired by
    the confidence that all these preparations were indeed effective.
    This conviction was deeply rooted in the practice of mummifying the
    dead, preserving the body so that it should become incorruptible and
    everlasting; and this was supposed also to involve the feasibility of
    the prolongation of the dead man’s existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hope of survival was thus based upon
    <span class="pagenum" >47</span> the efficacy of the
    embalmer’s art; and the extraordinary constancy with which for more
    than thirty centuries—for a span of years four times the length of
    time that separates us from the arrival of William the Conqueror in
    Britain—they persisted in their efforts to improve their methods and
    render more perfect this gruesome practice is a striking tribute to the
    fundamental importance of mummification to the Egyptians. The craft
    of the carpenter was first invented for the manufacture of coffins to
    protect the corpse; the stonemason’s first experiments had for their
    aim the preparation of rock-cut chambers still further to ensure its
    safety; the first buildings worthy of being called architecture were
    intended to promote the welfare of the dead, to provide places to which
    relatives could bring food necessary for the dead man’s sustenance, and
    a room to house his portrait statue—another art that was the outcome
    of the practice of mummification—which took his place at the temple of
    offerings and preserved his likeness for all time.
  </p>

  <p>
    These elements of civilization, the arts of architecture and sculpture,
    and the crafts of the carpenter and the stonemason, were thus direct
    results of the custom of embalming.<span class="pagenum" >48</span>
    But its influence in moulding
    ritual and belief was no less profound and far-reaching.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Early Beliefs</i></h3>

  <p>
    The belief in the possibility of the continuation of existence after
    death may have been (and probably was) much older than the Egyptians;
    but the evidence now available seems fairly decisive that the belief
    in immortality was not definitely formulated by mankind until the
    means had been devised of making the corpse everlasting, when “the
    corruptible body put on incorruption.” Moreover, the ritual of the most
    primitive religions was based upon the practices of the early Egyptians
    for revivifying the mummy, or its surrogate, the mortuary statue, by
    burning incense, pouring out libations, opening its mouth to give it
    the breath of life, and performing a series of dramatic acts to animate
    it. By means of these ritual procedures it was supposed that the
    officiating priest was able to restore consciousness to the dead body
    and so make it possible for it not only to take an intelligent share in
    the life around it, but also to hear appeals for help and guidance and
    to answer such requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    Egypt alone of the countries of antiquity
    <span class="pagenum" >49</span> provides the explanation
    of these strange beliefs and practices. They were devised by the
    concrete-minded people of the Nile Valley as part of a comprehensive
    philosophy of life and death which was formulated as a sort of life
    insurance, in accordance with the principles of which the deceased
    himself was supposed to be the beneficiary, and his reward an
    indefinite prolongation of existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This remarkable system of beliefs originated even before the
    beginning of civilization, sixty centuries ago; but the latter event
    was responsible for intensifying the conviction of its reality and
    increasing men’s hope in its potency.
  </p>

  <h3><i>The Dawn of Civilization</i></h3>

  <p>
    Civilization began when the Egyptians first devised the methods of
    agriculture and invented a system of irrigation. The irrigation
    engineer was the first man in the history of the world to control
    and organize the co-operative work of his fellow-men, and become the
    ruler of a whole community. If there is one lesson more than another
    that history has demonstrated in Egypt, equally in ancient and in
    modern times, it is the absolute necessity of a strong and autocratic
    Government,<span class="pagenum" >50</span>
    because the conditions in the Nile Valley are such that
    the prosperity of the country and the welfare of the whole community
    is entirely dependent upon the just and equitable distribution of the
    waters of irrigation throughout the land. It is not to be wondered
    at that the engineer who successfully achieved this task, and in a
    very special and real sense controlled the lives and destinies of his
    people, became the king, whose beneficence was apotheosized after his
    death, so that he became the god Osiris, who was identified with the
    river, whose life-giving powers he controlled. For to a people who
    had never experienced anything of the kind before it must have seemed
    an altogether miraculous and superhuman act for one man to have in
    his absolute control the prosperity of a whole community and every
    individual unit of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The connection between this story and the tomb of Tutankhamen may not
    be apparent. But when it is realized that the original invention of
    the social system was so closely identified with the god Osiris, it
    will be understood that the ritual of mummification and burial aimed at
    identifying the deceased with Osiris, and by imitating the incidents
    of his story to secure for the deceased a fate like that of the god,
    whose life-giving powers were sought to grant the continuation of
    existence.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum" >51</span>

      <span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—Part of a mace-head found by Mr J. E. Quibell at
      Hierakonpolis in 1897-8, showing one of the earliest kings of Egypt
      engaged in the task of cutting an irrigation canal.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The early kings of Egypt, rich in their newly acquired control of the
    labour and wealth of their dominion, did not hesitate to squander both
    in the preparation of their tombs, in the vain belief that thereby they
    were making certain their own survival. Twenty centuries later, in the
    times of Tutankhamen, they were still obsessed with the same idea, and
    spent fabulous sums in preparing their tombs in the Biban el Moluk.
  </p>

  <p>
    The peculiar importance of the study of these strange customs and
    beliefs in Egypt depends upon the fact that, not only were they
    invented by the Egyptians, and preserved in their entirety, so that
    the whole story of its development can be read in all their childish
    directness and simplicity, but also because other peoples of antiquity,
    to whose civilization Europe owes her own heritage, adopted some of the
    results of these Egyptian devices, and, after eliminating some of their
    cruder details, transformed them into the essentials of the world’s
    civilization. Hence, in recovering the history of Egyptian cultural
    development, we are really probing into the sources of the customs
    and beliefs of<span class="pagenum" >53</span>
    our own everyday life and experience. Thus we must
    regard mummification as something more than an eccentric practice that
    excites our curiosity. For it played a fundamental part in shaping the
    development of civilization, both its arts and crafts, as well as its
    most vital customs and beliefs.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Giving Life to the Dead</i></h3>

  <p>
    If we turn to consider the process of mummification, and the aims of
    its practitioners, it will be found that throughout the long ages in
    which it was in vogue the Egyptian embalmer kept constantly striving to
    attain two aims. His first object was to preserve the actual tissues
    of the body as thoroughly as he could. But he was also attempting the
    much more difficult task of preserving the natural form of the body,
    and especially of the features. He was prompted to make this effort,
    not merely that the deceased should retain his distinctive traits in
    a recognizable form, but rather that the simulacrum should be the
    “living” image of himself. In other words, the aim was to make the
    representation of the dead man so life-like that he should, in fact,
    remain alive, and be certain of maintaining his existence.
    <span class="pagenum" >54</span> The early
    Egyptians seem to have entertained in all its childlike <i>naïveté</i> the
    belief that they were actually conferring vitality upon the image
    when they made it life-like. The Egyptian verb for describing the
    work of the sculptor who carved the portrait statue meant literally,
    according to Dr Alan Gardiner, “to give birth,” in the sense of “giving
    life”; and there is no doubt they meant this idea of life-giving to be
    accepted as the simple expression of a fact, and not merely as a symbol
    or analogy.
  </p>

  <p>
    It must not be forgotten that when these beliefs were first formulated,
    more than fifty centuries ago, there was no knowledge or understanding
    of the principles of physics and biology to hinder the adoption of such
    naïve fancies as the simple and obvious truth. There is no reason to
    doubt that the philosophers of those days did honestly believe in the
    possibility of prolonging existence by fulfilling all the conditions
    that seemed to them essential and adequate to the maintenance of
    vitality.
  </p>

  <p>
    When mummification was first devised, probably at the time of the
    earliest dynasty (about 3400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) it was realized that if, in
    the climate of Egypt, the preservation of the tissues of the body was
    not very difficult to<span class="pagenum" >55</span>
    effect, the task of retaining the distinctive
    features was practically unattainable. All kinds of devices were
    tried, during the second, third, and fourth dynasties, by wrapping
    the mummy so as to simulate the human form, painting it, applying
    clay or resinous paste, and modelling it into a portrait statue upon
    the enshrouded mummy itself. When these devices failed to achieve the
    desired aim of making life-like portraits, the art of modelling statues
    of the deceased in stone or wood was invented, and paint and artificial
    eyes were used to make them as life-like as possible. The skill
    with which the Egyptians of the Pyramid Age overcame the technical
    difficulties of the sculptors’ art and made life-size portraits which,
    as I have said before, could not untruthfully be called “living
    images,” is one of the most amazing achievements in the history of art.
    But it was more than the triumph of a craftsman: it was the realization
    of a deeper desire to preserve the image, and so prolong the existence
    of the sculptor’s model, the deceased, who was thus supposed to have
    been saved from annihilation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first chapter of my book <i>The Evolution of the Dragon</i>, I have
    discussed this problem more fully.

  <h3><i>Success after Twenty Centuries</i></h3>

  <p>
    Although these early sculptors had achieved so signal a triumph, the
    embalmers never abandoned the hope of bringing their art to such a
    state of perfection as to make of the mummy itself the simulacrum of
    the deceased. With infinite patience and persistence they experimented
    through one millennium after another to attain this object. But
    it was not<span class="pagenum" >58</span>
    until the time of the twenty-first dynasty, more than
    twenty centuries after they first attempted to do it, that they were
    able to transform the mummy itself into a portrait statue. From the
    artistic point this represents to us a debasement of æsthetic motive
    and practice; but to the embalmer it was the culmination of his
    achievement. But it was also the prelude to the degradation of his art.
    For the technique became so complex and difficult of execution that
    failure became a common incident, and to disguise the evidence of such
    incompetence the practice grew up of paying chief attention to the
    external appearance of the wrappings rather than to the corpse.
  </p>

      <span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—The “packed” mummy of a Queen of the
      Twenty-first Dynasty.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    But to us the complicated technique of the embalmers during the
    twenty-first dynasty appeals rather as ingenious trickery, a tampering
    with the natural body to give it a spurious and trumpery resemblance to
    a living being. Judged by our artistic standards there can be no doubt
    that the ancient Egyptian practice of mummification was seen at its
    best at the end of the eighteenth dynasty, that is about the time of
    Tutankhamen. The most successful results are revealed in the mummies of
    Yuaa and Tuaa and of Seti I (Fig. 3, p. 33),
    <span class="pagenum" >59</span> which means that at the
    time when Tutankhamen was embalmed the craftsmen had the skill and the
    material resources to make as perfect a mummy as Egyptian ingenuity in
    the whole of its experience was capable of doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the Egyptian tomb-robbers brought to the attention of the official
    world many mummies of the earlier part of the eighteenth dynasty,
    as well as some of those of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties
    respectively before and after the culmination of the technical success
    in or about Tutankhamen’s time which revealed only too clearly certain
    faults that it seemed desirable to remedy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wholesale plundering of the Royal mummies in the twentieth
    dynasty, and the knowledge acquired by the priests when remedying
    the damage so inflicted, seem to have been responsible for the rapid
    transformation of the methods in the twenty-first dynasty. For this
    experience afforded them a unique opportunity of studying the results
    and appreciating the defects of their predecessors’ work.
  </p>

  <p>
    That they profited by this experience is evident from the changes
    they effected in their technique after they had realized wherein the
    <span class="pagenum" >60</span>
    methods employed during the twentieth dynasty failed to attain the
    desired aim. For their innovations were directed towards remedying
    the most obtrusive distortions found in the mummies of the nineteenth
    and twentieth dynasties. The sunken cheeks were filled out by means
    of packing them with linen or mud, artificial eyes were inserted, the
    nose, lips, and ears were protected from distortion by wax plates, and
    the cheeks were painted. Many other devices were introduced to convert
    the mummy from a shrunken caricature into a more life-like portrait.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mummification reached its fullest and most successful development
    during the six centuries from 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 940
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
    which represents the period of the collection of royal mummies in the
    Cairo Museum. They reveal the ancient Egyptian practice of embalming in
    its highest perfection, and have provided most of the information we
    possess of the history of mummification.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have called attention to the aims which the ancient Egyptians kept so
    persistently in view in constructing and furnishing the tombs of their
    kings. The pharaoh’s body was embalmed to make sure of the continuation
    of his existence beyond the grave. The conviction
    <span class="pagenum" >61</span> that this object was
    really attained when the mummy was made and housed in an imperishable
    building induced them to furnish the tomb lavishly and to provide an
    ample store of food to sustain him and give him all the comforts and
    luxuries to which he was accustomed when he was living upon earth. But,
    to make doubly sure, they inscribed upon the walls of his tomb, upon
    his sarcophagus and coffins, and on papyri placed in the tombs, certain
    texts to make clear his identification with Osiris, with the practical
    object of ensuring that he should share the fate of the god and attain
    the immortality which the god had secured. Moreover, other devices were
    adopted to make the issue more certain.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Of the objects found in association with the mummies of Egyptian kings
    of the eighteenth dynasty to which definite cultural importance was
    attached, none is more remarkable than the so-called “germinating
    Osiris.” Several<span class="pagenum" >62</span>
    examples of this singular symbol were found in the
    tombs of Tutankhamen’s predecessors, as far back as Amenhotep II. (1420
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), and as it was observed in its fullest development
    in the tomb of his successor, Horemheb (1315 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), it is
    more probable than not that Tutankhamen’s will also be similarly
    equipped. It consists of a shallow box about 5 ft. long, shaped so as
    to represent the god Osiris, wearing a crown and holding the crook
    and whip in his hands. By means of wooden partitions the features
    of the head, the necklace, the arms are represented. This shallow
    box was filled with earth in which barley was planted; when it
    germinated and the sprouts had attained two or three inches in height a
    closely-fitting lid was fastened on to the box by wooden pegs. The lid
    is slightly sculptured en ronde bosse, and painted yellow. The details
    of the body and the ornaments are indicated in relief, the effect of
    which is heightened by lines of black and red.
  </p>

  <h3><i>The King and Osiris</i></h3>

  <p>
    The symbolism expressed in this remarkable procedure was in keeping
    with the motives which were explained earlier in this chapter, the
    identification of the dead king with Osiris (who was himself a dead
    king), whose magical<span class="pagenum" >63</span>
    powers as the bestower of renewed life and a
    continuation of existence after death was symbolized by the germinating
    barley.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the procedure was richly charged with the deepest religious
    significance. I have already explained that the whole of the burial
    customs of the early Egyptians and the dramatic ritual which formed
    part of the tomb ceremonies were inspired by the desire to ensure the
    prolongation of existence. The body was made imperishable and protected
    by every means the relatives could devise: it was supplied with
    abundance of food and all the necessaries of life; and, above all, the
    “germinating Osiris” was there to complete the process and perpetually
    to animate and prolong the existence of the corpse. If its potency
    was derived from the reproduction of the form of Osiris, an equally
    vital part of its supposed magical power was due to the fact that it
    consisted of barley in the act of producing new life.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the earliest cereal that was cultivated and the staple diet of
    the earliest civilized people—and the chief factor in creating their
    civilization—barley came to occupy a peculiarly distinctive rôle
    in early belief. It was the staff of life and the material from
    which beer was<span class="pagenum" >64</span>
    made, the drink which was regarded as “divine,” in
    the sense that life-giving qualities were attributed to it, and to
    the ancient Egyptian the essence of divinity was the attainment of
    unlimited existence. But the form assumed by a grain of barley (<i>i.e.</i>
    its similarity to the organ of birth, the giver of life) led to the
    assimilation of its life-sustaining with definitely life-giving
    functions. It was identified with the Great Mother as a life-giver
    (in her forms as Hathor or Isis); and the “corn mother” acquired the
    reputation of being able to prolong existence in other ways than
    providing food and drink. The coffin texts of the Middle Kingdom
    (<i>circa</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) translated by M. Lacau refer to the
    identification of the deceased with Osiris and barley, and in the
    Pyramid texts many centuries earlier the dead king is represented, as
    making the following claim: “I am Osiris. I live as the gods; I live
    as ‘Grain’; I grow as ‘Grain.’ I am barley.” (Professor Breasted’s
    translation.) Just as the Nile (which was personified as Osiris)
    conveyed new life to the grains of barley by irrigating them, so the
    god was supposed to be able to grant a new lease of existence to the
    dead.

      <span class="subhead">THE VALLEY OF THE TOMBS</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">It</span> was about the year 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> that the desolate and
    impressive ravine which is now known as the Valley of the Tombs of
    the Kings was chosen by King Thothmes I as the site for his tomb.
    His immediate predecessor Amenhotep I had observed the practice,
    which had prevailed since the temple was first invented, of building
    the tomb in association with it. For the temple was a development
    of the rooms provided at the tomb for the relations of the deceased
    to make offerings of food and drink to the dead for the essentially
    practical purpose of maintaining his existence. In these rooms also
    certain ceremonies were performed from time to time with the object of
    animating the dead man (or his portrait statue) so that he could enjoy
    the food and commune with his relations. But such functions were also
    part of the process of conveying “life” to him and so ensuring the
    maintenance of his existence.
  </p>

      Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, the most impressive site in the whole of
      Egypt.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In course of time as these ceremonies for conveying sustenance and
    life to a dead king assumed a wider significance the chamber of
    <span class="pagenum" >67</span>
    offering developed into a temple and a subtle change occurred in the
    meaning attached to the ritual. For instead of being regarded merely
    as a physical device for conveying food and the essence of life the
    ceremonies came to be regarded more and more as acts of worship of the
    dead king. When this happened the close nexus between the temple and
    the tomb was no longer so essential as it was in earlier times when the
    ceremonial in the former was intended to vitalize the corpse of the
    king (or<span class="pagenum" >68</span>
    his substitute the portrait statue). But it was not until
    the closing years of the sixteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (Thothmes
    I is believed to have died in 1501 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) that the king
    began to prepare a tomb for himself miles away from his temple. This
    geographical separation of the temple from the tomb had a far-reaching
    influence upon the functions of the former, and prepared the way for
    the modern conception of a house of worship, even though in Europe
    the ancient conception of the close association of a church and a
    churchyard (as a burying place) was retained. The practice inaugurated
    by Thothmes I of preparing royal tombs in the famous Theban Valley
    lasted from about 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> until the end of the twentieth
    dynasty, about 1090 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

    Amenhotep III, who was buried in 1375 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, broke away from
    the observances of his four predecessors who were buried in the Eastern
    Valley and made his tomb in the Western Valley; and his famous son and
    successor, Amenhotep IV, the heretic king Akhenaton, made the more
    daring innovation of preparing a tomb at his new capital, the City of
    the Horizon of Aton, on the site of the modern Tell el Amarna. It was
    a rock-cut tomb in the mountains about seven
    <span class="pagenum" >69</span> miles to the east of his
    new capital—which Akhenaton built midway (p. 22) between Thebes and
    Memphis, the ancient capitals of Upper and Lower Egypt respectively.
    There he seems to have been buried in the red granite sarcophagus that
    is now broken into fragments; but his son-in-law Tutankhamen, when
    he reverted to the orthodox religion of Thebes, thought it proper to
    remove the mummy of his father-in-law from the City of the Horizon to
    the Theban necropolis and made for it the resting place in the Valley
    of the Tombs, which was discovered in 1907 by Mr Arthur Weigall,
    who as Inspector of Antiquities for Upper Egypt was supervising the
    excavations endowed by the late Mr Theodore M. Davis.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fate of the mummy of Akhenaton’s successor Smenkhara is unknown:
    but Tutankhamen came after him, and Mr Howard Carter’s discovery has
    shown that he displayed his return to strict orthodoxy by making his
    tomb in the Eastern Valley among the worshippers of Amen. For some
    reason which has not been fully elucidated, his successor Ay made
    his tomb in the Western Valley and so was laid to rest alongside
    Amenhotep III, whose Minister he seems to have been during his life.
    He is supposed by some historians to have been the father or the
    foster-father of Nefertiti, the wife of Akhenaton.

    Until the discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb in the Eastern Valley last
    November it was believed (by Sir Gaston Maspero and others) that it
    would be found in the Western Valley. Until then Ay’s was the earliest
    royal tomb, after that of Amenhotep III, to be discovered, and as they
    were in the Western Valley, it seemed probable that Ay’s predecessor
    Tutankhamen had also been buried there. But when making the secondary
    tomb for Akhenaton in the Eastern Valley he seems to have made his own
    tomb there also, and so resumed the old practice, which was observed by
    all his successors for two and a half centuries with the exception only
    of his successor Ay.

    This wonderfully impressive gorge (Fig. 10, p. 66) is known to the
    modern Egyptians as the <i>Bab</i> (or <i>Biban</i>) <i>el Moluk</i>, the Gate (or
    Gates) of the Kings. It was known to travellers ever since it was made
    into the royal necropolis, and Greeks and Romans marvelled at the
    wonderful tunnel-like tombs there, as generations of tourists have done
    ever since. Strabo mentions his having seen forty of these tombs, but
    it is not clear from his account<span class="pagenum" >72</span>
    whether he did not include those of
    the Western Valley and perhaps the Tombs of the Queens and others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern research was inaugurated by the traveller Belzoni who opened the
    tomb of Seti I in 1819 and described the pictures on its walls (Fig.
    20 is copied from his notebook) before they were damaged or destroyed.
    He brought to London the magnificent “alabaster” sarcophagus of this
    pharaoh, which is now in Sir John Soane’s museum in Lincoln’s Inn
    Fields.
  </p>

  <p>
    The year 1881 will always be memorable for the earliest discovery
    of Royal mummies. Five years later, when the wrappings were removed
    from such pharaohs as Seti I and Rameses II, modern men had the novel
    experience of gazing upon the actual faces of these famous rulers of
    the remotely distant past, whose exploits had resounded through the
    civilized world for thirty centuries and more. On several occasions in
    former years the discovery of Royal mummies had been reported; but in
    every case further investigation failed to justify such claims, for
    they proved to be merely intrusive burials of unknown people belonging
    to times much later than the rifled tombs in which they were
    <span class="pagenum" >73</span> found.
    Examples of such mistakes in identification are the eighteenth dynasty
    mummy, now in the Cairo Museum, which was found in a pyramid at
    Sakkara, and at one time was supposed to be the son of King Pepi, of
    the sixth dynasty; and the skeleton (not a mummy) in the British Museum
    from the pyramid of Mykerinus, which has repeatedly been referred to as
    the bones, or even as the mummy, of that pharaoh.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discoveries made in the famous cache at Deir el Bahari in 1881, and
    in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings during the decade 1898-1908,
    revealed the only actual mummies of members of the royal family so far
    recovered, although the skeletons of much earlier members of the ruling
    house were found by M. de Morgan in the pyramids of Dashur nearly
    thirty years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long before the recovery of the actual bodies of these famous rulers
    the statues and bas-reliefs of some of them had familiarized us with
    their appearance; and inscriptions on their monuments and the ancient
    writings of the Egyptians and their neighbours had made us acquainted
    with certain of their exploits. The plundered tombs of some of the
    great kings of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties have been
    known and visited by tourists from the times of the Greek domination
    of Egypt, and contemporary documents refer to others. Moreover, twenty
    years before the mummies themselves were revealed, the dealers in
    antiquities began to offer for sale a series of papyri (most of which
    came to this country) giving accounts of the desecration of the royal
    Theban tombs.

  <h3><i>Tomb-robbers’ Confessions</i></h3>

  <p>
    In the late Lord Amherst’s collection, which was recently sold in
    London, there was a judicial papyrus of the reign of Rameses IX (about
    1125 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), reporting the trial of eight “servants of the High
    Priest of Amen,” who were arraigned for plundering the tomb of King
    Sebekemsaf of the thirteenth dynasty. The written depositions of the
    prisoners set before the pharaoh by the vizier, the lieutenant, the
    reporter, and the mayor of Thebes were translated by Professor Percy
    Newberry in these terms: “We opened the coffins and their wrappings,
    which were on them, and we found the noble mummy of the king. There
    were two swords and many amulets and necklaces of gold on his neck: his
    head was covered with gold. We tore off the gold that we
    <span class="pagenum" >76</span> found on the
    noble mummy of this god [<i>i.e.</i> the dead king who was identified
    with Osiris]. We found the royal wife also. We tore off all that we
    found from her mummy likewise, and we set fire to their wrappings. We
    took their furniture of gold, silver and copper vases, which we found
    with them.” The prisoners who made this confession were found guilty,
    and sentenced “to be placed in the prison of the temple of Amen,” to
    await “the punishment that our lord the pharaoh shall decide.” There
    are several other famous papyri reporting trials of desecrators of the
    royal tombs. In the Abbott papyrus (in the British Museum) inspectors
    submit a report on the tombs that were said to have been plundered, but
    the only one that had actually been robbed was that referred to in the
    confession just quoted from the Amherst papyrus. The two Mayer papyri
    in the Liverpool Free Public Museums relate to plundering in the Valley
    of the Tombs of the Kings. One of these is of special interest at the
    present moment because it relates to the violation of the tomb of
    Rameses VI, which is immediately above that of Tutankhamen. The robbers
    were discovered as the result of quarrels among themselves about the
    division of the spoil. This<span class="pagenum" >77</span>
    was one of the most disgraceful incidents
    in the whole history of tomb-plundering. The robbers, in their haste to
    get at the gold and jewels upon the mummies, usually chopped through
    the bandages, and mutilated the mummy in the process. But when, in
    1905, I removed the wrappings from the mummy of Rameses VI (which in
    ancient times had been removed to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where it
    was discovered by M. Loret in 1898), the body was found to be hacked
    to pieces. This was no mere accidental injury, but clearly intentional
    destruction of a malicious nature. It makes one realize the sort of
    vandalism Tutankhamen’s tomb so narrowly escaped.

  <h3><i>Hiding the Mummies</i></h3>

    The discovery of the royal mummies in 1881—and this applies with
    special force to the remains of the famous pharaohs Seti I and Rameses
    II—gave us the other side of the story, for it revealed the measures
    taken to protect the bodies of these kings from further injury, and
    the persistence with which the protectors of the tombs moved the
    mummies from one place to another in their endeavour to save them.
    The condition of<span class="pagenum" >78</span>
    affairs revealed in the tomb of Tutankhamen brings
    proof of what has long been suspected, that the work of the plunderer
    began soon after the closing of the chambers. But during the twentieth
    and twenty-first dynasties, when there was a rapid weakening of the
    Administration, tomb-robbing assumed proportions it had never attained
    before. The record inscribed upon the coffins of Seti I and Rameses
    II throws a lurid light on the extent of this loss of control. For a
    century and a half their mummies were moved from one hiding-place to
    another in the attempt to secure their safety. The mummy of the great
    Rameses was moved to the tomb of his father, Seti I, whose body for
    some time remained in its own alabaster sarcophagus, which is now in
    Sir John Soane’s Museum in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. But in the reign of
    Siamon (976-958 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) the two mummies were hidden in the tomb
    of a queen called Inhapi, and about ten years later were moved again,
    this time to a tomb that had been originally prepared for Amenhotep
    I at Deir el Bahari. Here they, together with more than thirty other
    royal mummies, remained undisturbed for more than twenty-eight
    centuries, until about fifty years ago they were rediscovered, and the
    successors of<span class="pagenum" >79</span>
    the ancient tomb-robbers of Thebes once more resumed the
    old process of depredation. But the late Sir Gaston Maspero had not
    studied the papyri of the twentieth dynasty in vain, for he obtained
    a confession that is worthy of being set beside those recorded in the
    Amherst and Mayer papyri.

  <p class="clear">
    The story of the ill-treatment of the royal mummies and of their
    repeated removal from one hiding-place to another prepared us in some
    measure for the discoveries that were<span class="pagenum" >80</span>
    made when the shrouds and linen
    bandages were removed. But in spite of this the investigation was full
    of surprises. Several of the mummies after being hastily rewrapped (in
    the twentieth or twenty-first dynasty) were put into the wrong coffins.
    So that, for example, when the mummy supposed to be Rameses I (of the
    nineteenth dynasty) was unwrapped, an old white-haired lady was found
    embalmed in a way distinctive of the early part of the eighteenth
    dynasty. And again, when the mummy in the coffin of Setnakht (the first
    king of the twentieth dynasty) was examined, it was found to be that of
    a woman embalmed in the manner distinctive of the time of Setnakht’s
    predecessor (Seti II, of the nineteenth dynasty); and it is probable
    that she is Queen Tausret, the wife in turn of the two kings, Siptah
    and Seti II. Such discoveries reveal the need for caution in claiming
    that the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings has yielded up all its hidden
    secrets. For there are many royal mummies that we know to have been
    buried there which have yet to be recovered.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the examination of the royal mummies reveals the thoroughness
    with which the tombs have been rifled—not one of the series
    <span class="pagenum" >81</span> has
    ever been found undisturbed—they also give us some idea of the value
    of the jewellery and amulets which excited the greed of the robbers
    thirty centuries ago. The torn and mutilated wrappings of the mummies
    often bear the impressions of magnificent pectoral ornaments, and of
    amulets on the forehead, neck, or limbs; and the occasional finding of
    fragments of these, made of gold, lapis lazuli, or carnelian, gives
    us some idea of the value and beauty of this extravagant equipment
    of the dead. But I have known only one instance of an object of any
    considerable intrinsic value escaping the diligent searching of these
    experienced robbers. During the examination (in 1909) of the badly
    plundered mummy of Queen Hontaui I found a large and beautifully
    embossed plate of pure gold, unique in size and in the elaboration of
    its design.
  </p>

  <p>
    From these considerations we can safely predict that if, as seems
    now to be certain, the unplundered mummy is found in the tomb of
    Tutankhamen jewellery of great value and beauty of design will
    probably be found on it. The superb workmanship displayed in making
    these ornaments and amulets is known to us from the discoveries
    made by M. de Morgan in the Pyramids at Dashur in
    <span class="pagenum" >82</span> 1893. These gold
    pectoral ornaments inlaid with precious stones were wrought with an
    amazing perfection of technical skill many centuries before the time
    of Tutankhamen; but the jewellery of the eighteenth and nineteenth
    dynasties now exhibited in many museums (especially the Cairo Museum
    and the Louvre) reveals that the skill in making such works of art had
    not been lost. The quality of the workmanship revealed in the objects
    found in the first chamber of Tutankhamen’s tomb should prepare us
    for the discovery on the mummy of ornaments even surpassing those of
    Rameses II in the Louvre (see Maspero, <i>Egyptian Art</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    But the chief interest in the discovery should be in the mummy itself,
    for the welfare of which all the elaborate arrangements were made.
    It is not merely because the mummies enable us to form some idea of
    the physical features of the kings and queens, and by appealing to
    our common humanity give their personalities a reality they would not
    otherwise possess; nor is it because they often reveal evidence of age
    and infirmities; their chief interest is the light they throw on the
    history of the period and upon the development of the art of embalming.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >83</span></p>

  <p>
    Perhaps I can best make plain what is meant by this statement if I
    refer to specific illustrations of the former kind of contribution the
    study of mummies makes to the fuller understanding of history.
  </p>

  <p>
    When in 1907 the bones were found that had once formed part of the
    mummy wrongly assumed to be the famous Queen Tiy, I discovered that
    they were the remains of a young man’s skeleton, for which, if it had
    been normal, it was difficult to admit an age of more than twenty-six
    years, if indeed as much. Now the archæological evidence seems to
    leave no loophole of escape from the conclusion that these bones are
    actually the skeleton of King Akhenaton; but, on the other hand, the
    historical evidence seems to demand an age of at least thirty years
    (or, according to a recent memoir by Professor Kurt Sethe, thirty-six
    years) for the famous heretic pharaoh. This apparent conflict between
    the two classes of evidence has stimulated an intensive study of the
    historical data and of the medical history of Akhenaton himself; and
    the final outcome of the investigations is likely to provide a most
    illuminating revelation of the inner meaning of perhaps the most human
    and dramatic incident that has<span class="pagenum" >84</span>
    come to us from ancient times. The
    peculiar features of Akhenaton’s head and face, the grotesque form
    assumed by his legs and body, no less than the eccentricities of his
    behaviour, and his pathetic failure as a statesman, will probably be
    shown to be due to his being the subject of a rare disorder, only
    recently recognized by physicians, who have given it the cumbrous name
    Dystocia adiposo-genitalis. One of the effects of this condition is
    to delay the process of the consolidation of the bones. Studying the
    history of modern instances of this affection the possibility suggests
    itself that Akhenaton might well have attained the age of thirty or
    even thirty-six years, although his bones are in a condition which
    in the normal individual is appropriate to the years twenty-two to
    twenty-six. It is tempting to speculate on the vast influence on the
    history of the world, not merely the political fate of Egypt and Syria
    in the fourteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but the religious conceptions
    of Palestine and the whole world for all time, for which the illness of
    this pacifist poet may have been largely responsible.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is still a vast amount of information to be got from the study of
    the royal mummies in the light of modern knowledge,
    <span class="pagenum" >85</span> and by the use of
    technical methods that are now for the first time available: and one
    of the hopes raised by the new discoveries is that it may be possible
    to set an example of how such work ought to be carried out, so as to
    extract from the remains of these ancient pharaohs all the information
    they can give us.
  </p>

  <p>
    The importance of the study of the technique of mummification as a
    means of revealing the past history of civilization (by affording
    evidence of the diffusion of culture which was the chief factor in the
    process of cultural development) is too large a subject to embark on
    here. I mention it only because most of the exact information we have
    of the history of embalming has been derived from the royal mummies
    themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my pamphlet <i>The Migrations of Early Culture</i> (1915) I made use of
    the evidence afforded by the geographical distribution of the practice
    of mummification to demonstrate the diffusion to the ends of the earth
    in ancient times of elements of culture that were derived directly or
    indirectly from Egypt.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the <i>Revue Neurologique</i> for 1920 two French physicians, Drs M.
    Ameline and P. Quercy, published a very curious memoir
    <span class="pagenum" >86</span> with the
    title “Le Pharaon Aménophis IV, sa mentalité. Fut-il atteint de
    Lipodystrophie Progressive?” I have used the adjective curious with
    reference to their work, because they have put forward a carefully
    reasoned statement in support of the diagnosis they suggest, but do not
    seem to have made any attempt to make themselves acquainted with the
    evidence provided by the remains of the pharaoh. When it is recalled
    that in 1912 I gave a detailed account (<i>The Royal Mummies</i>, Catalogue
    Générale du Musée du Caire) of the broken bones which were all that
    was left of the mummy of the pharaoh (no trace of the mummy of his
    mother, Queen Tiy, has been found), it is surprising to find in a
    scientific journal the following statements, written ten years after
    the appearance of my official report was published:—“on a retrouvé
    récemment (1905), à Thèbes même, les <i>momies</i> du pharaon <i>et de sa
    mère Tii</i>,” and, referring to the remains of Akhenaton, <i>i.e.</i> the
    broken fragments of the skeleton, “La momie, recouverte de feuilles
    d’or délicatement repoussé et d’un réseau d’or avec pierres et verres
    colorés, <i>est également exceptionnellement belle, mais ces ornements
    empêchent naturellement d’examiner le corps du pharaon aux rayons X et,
    a fortiori, d’en<span class="pagenum" >87</span> practiquer l’autopsie</i>?”
    (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 451. All the italics are mine).

      represented by the sculptor as suffering from the same dystocia as
      Akhenaton himself.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    I have quoted these purely imaginary statements to emphasize the
    fact that the distinguished physicians who made them were totally
    ignorant of the conditions revealed in the skull, and based their
    diagnosis wholly upon the pictures of Akhenaton and the history
    <span class="pagenum" >88</span> of his
    achievements. They describe the condition of progressive lipodystrophy
    as an affection characterized on the one hand by a progressive and
    complete disappearance of the subcutaneous fat of the upper part of the
    body; and, on the other, by a marked increase of the adipose tissue
    below the loins. The first example of this strange affection was
    described by Barraquer in 1907, but it is exceedingly rare in adult
    men. In fact the authors remark that “it would indeed be curious if a
    pharaoh, dead for thirty-five centuries, should provide a second case
    (after Gertsmann’s) of the occurrence of this condition in an adult
    man.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is unfortunate that these physicians neglected to study the report
    which I wrote for the General Catalogue of the Cairo Museum, published
    in the volume <i>The Royal Mummies</i> in 1912. For they would then have
    realized that the slight hydrocephalus, the indication of an early
    overgrowth of the jaw such as occurs in acromegaly, and then the
    gradual assumption of a feminine contour of figure, with a delayed
    union of the epiphyses, suggest the possibility that Akhenaton may have
    been the subject of Dystocia adiposo-genitalis.

  <p>
    The form of the head in Akhenaton, his daughters and some of the
    members of his family, more than half a century before his time, raises
    a problem of great difficulty and complexity.

  <p>
    There is no doubt that the slight malformation of Akhenaton’s head
    was due to pathological causes. It is equally certain that the gross
    distortion of the heads of his daughters,
    <span class="pagenum" >91</span> represented in the statues
    from Tell el Amarna which are now in Berlin, are the result of
    artificial deformation such as was and still is practised upon young
    children in Asia Minor and Northern Syria, with the royal family of
    which Akhenaton’s family was linked by close ties. But in addition
    the mummy of a boy in the tomb of Amenhotep II, which was certainly
    embalmed in the reign of that pharaoh and is probably the body of his
    son, has a skull which is exceptionally broad and flat, and when viewed
    from the front presents an appearance curiously similar to the portrait
    statues of Akhenaton’s daughters. The full significance of these
    peculiarities cannot be interpreted until the royal mummies now in the
    Cairo Museum are submitted to a thorough re-examination.

      <span class="subhead">THE STORY OF THE FLOOD</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">Just</span> half a century ago<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2">[2]</a> the proprietors of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>
    arranged with the Trustees of the British Museum to send Mr George
    Smith to Mesopotamia to search in the ruins of the library of
    Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh for missing fragments of inscribed tablets
    to fill the gaps in the <i>Chaldean Account of the Deluge</i>. The
    announcement of the discovery (in December 1872) aroused an intense
    and world-wide interest, and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> provided the funds
    for the new expedition. Although this version of the Story of the
    Flood was discovered in an Assyrian library no older than the seventh
    century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Mr George Smith predicted that the future
    would reveal it to be the survival of a more ancient version that had
    also indirectly been the inspiration of that recorded in the Book of
    Genesis. The recent discovery of the Sumerian prototype of this story,
    which <span class="pagenum" >93</span>
    was put into writing more than twenty centuries before the
    record in Ashur-bani-pal’s library, is a remarkable confirmation of
    George Smith’s prediction.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will come as a surprise to most people to learn that the Valley of
    the Tombs in Egypt has provided the information which is destined in
    time to afford the explanation of the early history of the Story of the
    Flood, before it began to exert a strange fascination upon the minds of
    men that led to its diffusion throughout the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inscribed upon the walls of the tomb of Seti I in the Theban
    necropolis—less than seventy years after the burial of Tutankhamen—is
    the remarkable story of the Destruction of Mankind. In spite of the
    fact that it was inscribed in this tomb as recently—in comparison with
    the Sumerian story—as 1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the strange confusion of
    archaic references which has made it so unintelligible to most modern
    scholars reveals the fact that its origin must be referred back to the
    fourth millennium. Although in the narrative found in Seti’s tomb the
    destruction is not brought about by the Flood, it is clear that the
    Egyptian and the Mesopotamian stories have a common origin and a common
    motive. For the essential<span class="pagenum" >94</span>
    incident in the latter is not the Flood, but
    the Destruction of Mankind which it brought to pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    If it be asked why this venerable story should be inscribed in the
    tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh, the answer is that its aim was to secure
    for the dead king those boons the attainment of which was the central
    motive of the tale. It records how old age began to affect the king,
    upon whose strength and virility the welfare of the whole community
    depended (see <a href="#Chapter_IV" title="Go to Chapter 4">Chapter IV</a>), and he became very sorely troubled when his
    subjects began to murmur about the failure of his powers, because in
    olden days the only way of safeguarding the prosperity of the kingdom,
    which was supposed to be wholly dependent upon the strength of its
    ruler, was to slay him when he began to fail and put in his place one
    whose vigour was at its prime.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essence of the story, which made it potent as a charm to secure the
    continued existence of the king (and it was for this reason that it
    was inscribed upon the walls of the king’s tomb) was that it describes
    how the ageing king circumvented fate (and the conventions of archaic
    society) by rejuvenating himself. The elixir of life was the blood
    of<span class="pagenum" >95</span>
    his slaughtered subjects; and the crime that was charged against
    them—the impiety and disloyalty, the original sin—was that they were
    murmuring among themselves about the king’s failing health. But when
    they had been slaughtered and the king had attained a renewal of his
    youth, he was overcome by the boredom of too prolonged an existence
    upon earth. So he mounted upon the back of the Celestial Cow and thus
    reached heaven and attained immortality.
  </p>

  <p>
    This remarkable story, which was intended as a magical device for
    securing the same fate for the pharaoh of the fourteenth century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as his remote prototype is said to have attained, also
    contains the germs of most of the mythology that has lasted longest
    and spread most widely in the early history of civilization. Although,
    so far as we are aware, this story is not found in Tutankhamen’s
    tomb, there is no doubt that it was current at his time, because it
    was inscribed upon the walls of one of his successor’s tombs little
    more than half a century later, and the narrative is obviously very
    old, being packed with archaic allusions and forms of expression.
    I have referred to it here because the symbolism expressed in some
    of the funerary furniture in Tutankhamen’s tomb
    <span class="pagenum" >96</span> is explained by
    this mythical story recorded in those of Seti I and Rameses III. The
    question of interpretation I have discussed in another chapter, dealing
    with the funerary couches, and I have mentioned the Destruction of
    Mankind to call attention to the dominant motive—the Giving of Life
    and the Attainment of Immortality—which inspires every feature of the
    funerary ritual with tiresome persistence. For in the myth mankind was
    destroyed to provide the elixir of life for the king so that he might
    attain to the immortality, which was the distinctive prerogative of a
    god. The blood of the slaughtered saints was the elixir by which the
    mortal dweller on earth put on the immortality of a celestial being.
    The motive assigned in the story for destroying mankind was their
    sinfulness or disloyalty, which was more exactly defined by accusing
    them of spreading rumours of the king’s increasing age and weakness, a
    form of report to which the ruler was peculiarly sensitive, because the
    admission that his strength and virility were failing was tantamount to
    a capital sentence. In the remotely distant age, from which the germs
    of this story came down to the time of Seti I, the ageing king had to
    be killed to make way for a more youthful
    <span class="pagenum" >97</span> and vigorous ruler. Hence
    one cannot marvel at the king’s sensitiveness when his people murmured
    about his failing powers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have already referred to the fact that this accusation of disloyalty
    was the earliest version of what theologians call “original sin,” and
    the story itself the prototype of that which under a modified form
    appears in the Book of Genesis. The primitive account of the slaying
    of mankind became confused with the inundation of the Nile, and the
    blood of the slaughtered human race and the blood-red inundation of the
    river became identified the one with the other. Though originally both
    events were regarded as beneficent and identical in their results, that
    is renewing the king’s strength and the country’s prosperity, when the
    story spread abroad to foreign countries a certain element of confusion
    crept into the narrative, and the destruction of mankind was attributed
    to the Flood. But it found a place in religious literature, not because
    it exemplified the wrath of the gods against sinful man, but because it
    explained how the king rejuvenated himself and attained the status of a
    god. The evidence provided by these Egyptian tombs gives us an insight
    into the motives underlying the religious beliefs of every people who
    came<span class="pagenum" >98</span>
    into relationship, directly or indirectly, with the arbitrary
    system of explaining the means of attaining immortality devised by the
    ancient priesthood of Egypt. It illustrates one of the ways in which
    these investigations in Egypt can illuminate ancient Jewish literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the peculiarities of Egyptian customs and beliefs is due to the
    fact that what the concrete-minded Egyptian naïvely did and said is
    to be interpreted in the literal and obvious sense that he attached
    to these acts. Among no other people can we similarly detect all the
    stages in the logical development of the practices and beliefs of
    civilization—and not only are the various stages preserved in Egypt,
    but in so crudely childlike a guise that he who overcomes the impulse
    to seek for some recondite or cryptic meaning in things which are
    really simple can read their plain story as their inventors intended it.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is this fundamental fact that gives the study of Egyptian customs
    and beliefs its tremendous importance. The essential elements of
    civilization were originally invented by the Egyptians, who gave them
    simpler and more obvious expression than other peoples, who borrowed
    them ready-made without acquiring the connecting stages in their
    <span class="pagenum" >99</span>
    development or the naïve explanation of their meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have introduced this subject for consideration as an introduction to
    the study of the funerary equipment of Tutankhamen’s tomb, to which the
    next chapter will be devoted.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">It</span> is not my intention to attempt to discuss the equipment of
    Tutankhamen’s tomb. Readers of the daily papers and the illustrated
    weeklies will already be aware of the vast quantity of furniture and
    of the fact that even those who were already familiar with the superb
    design and workmanship displayed in the objects from such tombs as
    those of Thothmes IV, Yuaa and Tuaa, and Akhenaton were amazed at
    the new revelation of Egyptian craftsmanship revealed in scores of
    the things found in Tutankhamen’s tomb, the throne, a superb work
    of art, the no less wonderful chariots, chairs, couches, statues,
    sandals, textiles and jewellery, and above all the impressive canopy
    or shrine. Archæologists familiar with all the marvels of Egyptian
    art, now treasured in the museums scattered throughout the world, have
    exhausted their vocabularies of wonder and admiration in attempting to
    depict the splendours of Tutankhamen’s<span class="pagenum" >101</span>
    tomb. The outstanding feature
    of the discovery is, in fact, the recovery of so vast a collection of
    superb works of art and the new revelation it affords of the dazzling
    brilliance of Egyptian civilization thirty centuries ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    But in this book I am concerned more especially with the cultural
    significance of the funerary equipment.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first place the objects found in the tomb belong to two distinct
    categories, those which were used by the deceased when alive, and
    others specially made for funerary purposes. This distinction seems to
    be brought out most clearly in the comparison of the chariots in the
    vestibule and in the burial chamber respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not propose to enter into any further discussion of the contents
    of the wonderful shrine or canopy which is to be investigated next
    winter, nor to attempt to anticipate the result of the examination of
    the so-called “canopic” chest, which is said to be a unique example of
    the sculptor’s art. The experience gained in investigating the contents
    of such chests in other tombs gives one confidence in assuming that
    the heart of Tutankhamen will not be found in it, as so many writers
    imagine,<span class="pagenum" >102</span>
    but that its four compartments will contain respectively the
    liver, lungs, stomach and intestines of Tutankhamen, his “heart and
    reins” being left in his body.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the cultural point of view the most interesting articles of
    furniture found in Tutankhamen’s tomb are the three lofty couches
    fashioned in grotesque shapes to represent conventionalized animals,
    cow, lion, and hippopotamus respectively. Although such couches are
    thoroughly Egyptian in design and are familiar in pictures from Egypt
    and the Soudan, they have never been seen before. They are worth
    discussing in some detail, because they express the concreteness and
    naïvety of Egyptian belief mentioned in the last chapter in a way that
    brings home to us the essential distinction of the religion of the
    ancient dwellers in the Nile Valley.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem of getting to heaven after death was approached by
    the Egyptian theologian as though it were essentially a physical
    proposition. How was the dweller upon earth to reach the world in
    the sky? What vehicle could he employ to reach the celestial realms?
    Speaking recently of Christian Englishmen in the twentieth century,
    Dean Inge is reported to have said that “a topographical heaven, so
    <span class="pagenum" >103</span>
    impossible scientifically, was so difficult to dispense with as an
    aid to the imagination.” But to the ancient Egyptian belief in such a
    topographical heaven was a cardinal article of faith, and the geography
    of the Elysian fields and the details of the path leading to it were
    mapped out with all the meticulous precision of a modern guide-book.
    The dead man was often provided with a chart to find his way along the
    path that teemed with difficulties and dangers.
  </p>

  <p>
    But although there were scores of different devices for securing a safe
    transit to the celestial regions, there was one vehicle which from the
    very beginning of Egyptian history enjoyed a special reputation as
    the appropriate means of protecting the dead and conferring life and
    immortality upon him by conveying him to the other world. The Celestial
    Cow Hathor not only conferred life upon mortals by giving them birth:
    she also sustained them throughout life by giving them the divine milk,
    and at death she conveyed them to the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the famous inscription upon the walls of the tomb of Seti I, to
    certain passages of which I referred in the last chapter, there is a
    remarkable story of the function of the Divine Cow Hathor or Nut as a
    means of<span class="pagenum" >104</span>
    raising the dead king to the sky to reach the home of the
    gods. After being rejuvenated by the goddess the king became oppressed
    with the boredom of life upon earth amongst his tiresome subjects,
    who had shown their disloyalty to him by referring to his old age and
    failing powers. So he decided to leave the earth and proceed to the
    sky. Hence he mounted upon the back of the cow and got to heaven, where
    he assumed his godhead by becoming identified with the sun.
  </p>

  <p>
    This function of the cow in acting as a vehicle to convey the mummy to
    its celestial home is one which was repeatedly depicted in the ancient
    Egyptian monuments. But the cow’s solicitude for the welfare of the
    dead was frequently shown in other ways. A favourite <i>motif</i> for the
    Egyptian sculptor was the representation of the Divine Cow, Hathor,
    protecting the dead king or permitting him to obtain an elixir of life
    by drinking milk from her udder. In his book <i>Egyptian Art</i> (1913) the
    late Sir Gaston Maspero devotes to this subject a whole chapter (XI)
    illustrated with six beautiful photographic plates of such cow-statues
    ranging from the time of Amenhotep II (1440 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) to more
    than a thousand years later. But we know that the protective
    <span class="pagenum">105</span> function
    of the Cow Hathor was portrayed in other ways as early as the time
    of the Pyramid-builders (for example, the beautiful slate statuettes
    found by Professor Reisner in the Pyramid Temple of Mykerinus of the
    fourth dynasty, about 2800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), and the still earlier
    representation of her upon the slate palette of King Narmer of the
    first dynasty, about 3400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> For several reasons this
    palette is a historical document of unique importance. Engraved upon it
    is the earliest example of <span class="pagenum" >106</span>
    writing that has come down from antiquity:
    but it is of interest in connexion with the discussion in this chapter.
    For at the upper corners of the palette the cow-headed Hathor is
    depicted and as a further protection the king wears upon his belt four
    cows’ heads (Fig. 18) in place of the cowrie amulets of more primitive
    peoples.

    The Celestial Cow, Hathor, was a divinity of the dead, for she was the
    Giver of Life who was supposed to be able to prolong existence beyond
    the grave, and as she was also identified<span class="pagenum">107</span>
    with the sky she became the

    the sun-god dwelt.

    The most bizarre objects found in the vestibule of Tutankhamen’s tomb
    are the three ceremonial couches, one representing the Celestial Cow,
    Hathor, the second the same goddess in her lioness form, or more
    probably her son and representative Horus in the form of a lion, and
    the third Tauert, the hippopotamus goddess, who was the divine midwife.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the numerous accounts of these remarkable monstrosities that have
    appeared, I have not seen any attempt to explain their significance.
    Although such grotesque examples of mortuary furniture have never been
    seen before, the bas-reliefs upon the walls of tombs in Egypt and
    Ethiopia, and the pictures illustrating the Book of the Dead inscribed
    on papyri, have made us familiar with them. Moreover, the chapters of
    the Book of the Dead relating to “the raising of the funeral bed” leave
    no doubt as to the ritual significance of these couches.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sides of the Hathor couch are grotesque models of the Divine Cow,
    the earliest of the Great Mothers who were believed to have bestowed
    life and prosperity on mankind. It<span class="pagenum">108</span>
    may seem strange that the artists
    of Tutankhamen’s time should have perpetrated such a monstrosity as
    this Hathor couch. When religious motives impelled the designers to
    fashion a piece of furniture in imitation of so uncouchlike a creature
    as a cow, the artist was set a task which was almost impossible of
    realization unless he sacrificed his artistic ideals. There can be
    no doubt that in this case he escaped the dilemma by repressing his
    æsthetic feelings and abandoning himself whole-heartedly to the task of
    devising a model which was almost wholly religious in conception.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand why the cow, of all creatures, should have been selected
    for this purpose, we must remember the relentless logic and persistency
    that inspired all the preparations of the tomb and its furniture.
    The mummification of the body and the elaborate arrangements for
    protecting it and ministering to its wants were due to the belief
    that the continuance of the deceased’s existence had been secured by
    these preparations. But to make doubly certain, no device that would
    contribute to the attainment of this aim was neglected. Inscriptions
    were made on the walls of the tomb, on the sarcophagus and coffins,
    and on papyri to ensure the identification of the deceased king with
    Osiris, so that he might be made to share the god’s fate. A figure
    of Osiris was made, as I have explained elsewhere (p. 61), out of
    the sacred barley, every grain of which was regarded as a model of
    the life-giving Great Mother, and as such a supply of vital essence
    to maintain the deceased’s existence. From time to time dramatic
    ceremonies were held at the tomb (or in the temple associated with it
    in far-off Thebes) to reanimate the dead and help him to persist.

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">110</span>
    For, once the ancient Egyptians had persuaded themselves that they
    could work out their own salvation, and that the kingdom of heaven
    could be attained by certain physical and magical procedures, they
    spared no pains to pursue this train of thought and action with
    tiresome persistence to the most surprising ends.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Great Mother was originally nothing more than the personification
    of an amulet, like a cowrie shell or a grain of barley, that was
    supposed to be able to exert the essentially maternal function of
    life-giving. Then, when cattle were domesticated and mankind discovered
    for the first time that cow’s milk could be used for feeding human
    children, people were profoundly impressed with this
    <span class="pagenum" >111</span> revelation of
    the cow’s kinship with the human family. They regarded her as the
    foster-mother, and then as the actual mother of mankind, and identified
    her with the Great Mother Hathor, whose earliest form was (even sixty
    centuries ago) that of a Divine Cow. But if the Great Mother was at one
    and the same time a cowrie, a grain of barley, and a cow, she was also
    identified with the moon, which in a very special sense was supposed to
    control the life-giving powers of womenkind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hence the belief developed that if the Great Giver of Life and
    Immortality was both a cow and the moon, she was the appropriate
    vehicle to convey the dead king to the celestial realms in the sky.
    And so, as the nursery rhyme puts it, “the cow jumped over the moon.”
    That the cow represented in the couch is a symbol of the sky is shown
    by the stars on the under surface of the body. The height of the
    couches also was an additional indication of their identification with
    the sky. In all periods of Egyptian history painters and writers were
    fond of depicting this episode of the conveyance of the dead king to
    heaven on the cow’s back. This incident is shown and explained in the
    inscriptions on the walls of Seti I’s tomb, to which I have already
    referred<span class="pagenum" >112</span>
    (p. 95). But in later times it became common to represent
    the Divine Cow (or its lioness surrogate) conveying the dead man or
    his actual mummy to the sky, and in pictures of funerals to find the
    mummy borne on just such couches as have actually been found in the
    tomb of Tutankhamen. The object of the cow-shaped couch was to ensure
    by magical means this translation of the deceased to heaven. The story
    of the Destruction of Mankind gives the Egyptian’s own interpretation
    of the incident. The influence of this Egyptian conception of animal
    “vehicles” for gods spread far and wide throughout the world in
    ancient times, for if such a creature could convey the dead king to
    the celestial regions and confer upon him the means of attaining
    immortality, which was the distinctive attribute of divinity, such an
    animal vehicle was an appropriate symbol and pictorial determinative
    of a god. The identification of the Great Mother with the cow was the
    beginning of the social system known as totemism.
  </p>

  <p>
    The explanation of the lioness form of the Great Mother is also given
    in the inscription in Seti I’s tomb. When the goddess was called upon
    to rejuvenate the ageing king, the
    <span class="pagenum" >113</span> only elixir of life known in her
    pharmacopœia was human blood. Hence, she was driven to the necessity
    of slaying a human being, and her murderous action was compared to
    that of a man-slaying lioness, with which she was identified. But as
    the lioness was a particularly appropriate form to symbolize the Great
    Mother’s ability to protect the mummy from the perils that lurked
    in the pathway to the other world, it became an even more favourite
    form of the funerary vehicle than the gentle cow. At any rate, in the
    pictures of funerary couches the lioness form is much commoner than the
    cow-form. The same grotesque form of the lion has survived in modern
    heraldry.
  </p>

  <p>
    But other ideas found expression in the lion-symbolism. For example,
    on some of the beautiful pieces of furniture found in Tutankhamen’s
    tomb the king himself is represented as a human-headed lion trampling
    on his foes, and many of his predecessors before him, Thothmes IV for
    example, were similarly represented. Even as far back as the time of
    the Pyramids was not Mykerinus (2800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) represented as a
    human-headed lion in the gigantic Sphinx at the Giza Pyramids?
  </p>

  <p>
    This representation of the king as a lion,
    <span class="pagenum" >114</span> which typifies his
    identification with Horus, is inspired by another chain of ideas.
    Although at the time of Tutankhamen, and in fact throughout the whole
    history of Egypt in dynastic times the sun-god was dominant in Egypt
    and Horus himself was a sun-god, the rôle that he took as the guardian
    of the dead was inspired by the more ancient Osirian faith. It was the
    living king Horus who was responsible for tending the dead king Osiris;
    and it was believed that the continued existence of the god (the dead
    king Osiris) was wholly dependent upon the services rendered by Horus.
    Thus it was Horus who performed the divine function of conferring
    immortality upon Osiris, and also upon the dead king Tutankhamen, who
    was identified with Osiris. Presumably the act of being borne upon the
    lion-couch was symbolically equivalent to being put into the care of
    Horus, not the Horus represented upon the furniture in the tomb, the
    lion-avatar of Tutankhamen who tramples his enemies under foot, but the
    son of Osiris, who holds out the promise of conferring upon the dead
    king the boons that he is credited with having given to Osiris—eternal
    life and protection. The confusion between these two aspects of Horus
    is brought out very clearly
    <span class="pagenum" >115</span> in a very interesting picture recently
    discovered by Professor George A. Reisner (and reproduced in <i>The
    Illustrated London News</i>, 10th February 1923, p. 204), engraven upon
    a monument in the Soudan several centuries later than the time of
    Tutankhamen. The lion-couch is represented supporting the mummy of King
    Ergamenes, whose head is portrayed in the form of the falcon of Horus.
    Above the mummy is the star-spangled sky, below which is seen the
    sun’s disc emitting five streams of life-giving emanations to the dead
    king. In the Book of the Dead Chapter LXXVIII is called that “whereby
    one assumeth the form of the Sacred Falcon” and the deceased is
    represented as saying “I display myself as the Sacred Falcon whom Horus
    hath invested with his soul for taking possession of his inheritance
    from Osiris” (Renouf). The possibility suggests itself whether the
    lion-couch was intended to symbolize, as the cow-couch unquestionably
    was, the transference of the dead king to the sky to be united with
    the sun and identified with the solar deity Re. If so, perhaps the
    five streams of V-shaped emanations pointing to the disc were meant to
    represent the sun drawing the mummy, the dead Horus, to the sky.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >116</span></p>

  <p>
    In his monograph of the <i>Tomb of Amenemhēt</i> Dr Alan Gardiner
    reproduces a text (Plate XXX A) including a pictorial arrangement
    of hieroglyphs in the form of stars above the mummy borne on the
    lion-couch, which he translates as a statement that the dead man
    “wishes to be placed among the stars in the firmament” (p. 119).
  </p>

  <p>
    The same design occurs in the pictures illustrating the Book of the
    Dead. The funerary couch is usually represented in the lion-form, the
    cow- and hippopotamus-varieties being much less frequently adopted.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the pictures of funerals it is not uncommon to see the mummy borne
    upon a lion-shaped couch placed within the funerary canopy or shrine
    (as in the first of the pictures from the Book of the Dead, Fig. 20).
    Good examples are given by Dr Alan Gardiner and Mrs de Garis Davies in
    <i>The Tomb of Amenemhēt</i> (1915), Plates XII and XXIV, of the reign of
    Thothmes III, a century before Tutankhamen. No doubt this is due partly
    to the significance attached to the conception of Horus as the guardian
    of Osiris, but also possibly to the idea that Horus fought the enemies
    of Re and was the best protector of the deified dead.

      bird-soul is bringing to the mummy the symbol of eternity.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >118</span></p>

  <p>
    But underlying the whole of the lion-symbolism are two fundamental
    ideas which gave meaning to it. In the very ancient story of the
    Destruction of Mankind, which in a relatively modern and much
    distorted form was inscribed upon the walls of the tombs of several
    of Tutankhamen’s successors, the goddess Hathor (the Divine Cow) is
    reported to have made a human sacrifice in order to obtain the blood
    wherewith to rejuvenate the senile king (in the story Re, the king
    upon earth who had not yet been elevated on the cow’s back to the
    sky to become the sun-god). Hence she acquired the reputation as a
    slayer of men and was identified with a lioness, and called Sekhmet,
    the Destroyer. Thus the lioness and the cow were both forms assumed
    by the Great Mother Hathor. But in the development of the myth of the
    Destruction of Mankind the god Horus takes the place of his mother
    Hathor, and the bull and the lion take the place formerly occupied by
    the cow and the lioness. In the case of the funerary couches the Cow of
    Hathor is found alongside the lion of Horus, but occasionally one finds
    in late tombs the mummy represented as being conveyed to the celestial
    realms by a bull instead of the more usual cow. A good
    <span class="pagenum" >119</span> example of this
    is to be seen in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh.
  </p>

  <p>
    The third couch is modelled in the form of a grotesque caricature of a
    hippopotamus, Tauert, another representative of the Great Mother Hathor.
    But her special duty was to act as a midwife at the births of gods
    and kings. In pictures she is often associated with the Hathor Cow at
    the door of the tomb in the Mountain of the West; and presumably her
    function was to preside at the rebirth of the dead king by which a new
    lease of life beyond the grave was conferred upon him.
  </p>

  <p>
    If it seems far-fetched to regard the hippopotamus couch as symbolizing
    rebirth, it should not be overlooked that in the so-called “Birth
    Terrace” of the temple at Deir el Bahari<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3">[3]</a> lion-headed couches are
    represented in the birth scene of Queen Hatshepsut. As I have pointed
    out already all three animals, cow, lioness, and female hippopotamus,
    represent primarily different forms of the same goddess Hathor.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The Egyptian custom of making these grotesque animal-shaped couches
    to symbolize <span class="pagenum" >120</span>
    the transference of the dead to the celestial regions
    and the conferring of immortality and deification upon them exerted
    far-reaching and manifold effects as it was diffused abroad among other
    peoples. I shall mention three examples of these diverse influences.
    The belief implied in such symbolism that a king borne by such an
    animal vehicle was transformed into a god led to the use of such
    designs in the representations of gods. Hence it became common in Syria
    and Mesopotamia, in Greece and India, and far away in outlying parts
    of the world<span class="pagenum" >121</span>
    where the influence of these civilizations played some
    part, directly or indirectly, to find gods and goddesses represented on
    animal vehicles, such as the bull or cow, the lion or lioness, or some
    fantastic composite monster, dragon or makara. The whole conception
    of animal vehicles, which plays such a large part in the religious
    symbolism of India, Eastern Asia and Central America, is a purely
    Egyptian fancy that finds such grotesque expression in Tutankhamen’s
    funerary couches, no less than
    in the borrowed symbolism that was
    spread abroad from Egypt to Asia and America.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >122</span></p>

  <p>
    Another expression of the essential meaning of these couches was the
    belief that the placing of the corpse or mummy on a raised stage
    was magically efficacious in transferring the deceased to the sky-world.
    The use of such raised platforms is practised over a very wide
    geographical area, and for the reasons given in my pamphlet <i>The
    Migrations of Early Culture</i> (1915). There can be no doubt that it
    gives expression to the same belief as the lofty and uncouth funerary
    beds in Tutankhamen’s tomb have forced upon our attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another wave of diffusion of culture is represented in the adoption by
    European furniture-makers of the Egyptian method of designing legs for
    chairs, beds and couches. In Egypt itself such a practice can be traced
    back to the first dynasty 3400 or more <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But the lion paws
    were adopted in Europe as a design for legs of chairs, etc. almost as
    soon as the Egyptian craft of carpentering and joinery was introduced.
    Long after the Queen Anne period Chippendale introduced the Chinese
    variant, the dragon’s feet grasping the moon-pearl symbol. But as I
    explained in <i>The Evolution of the Dragon</i> (1919) the
    <span class="pagenum" >123</span> dragon is really
    a blending of Horus’s falcon (eagle) and lion into one composite beast.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus the study of these couches has revealed the development in Egypt
    of a very peculiar but distinctive series of symbolic expressions, each
    of which is so arbitrary and unexpected that one is able to recognize
    it and refer it to its true source, in whatever part of the world and
    at whatever historical period it manifests itself. Hence we are able
    to use the evidence provided by these three distinct aspects of one
    essential idea to demonstrate different waves of cultural diffusion
    which spread from Egypt throughout the world both in ancient and modern
    times.

    <h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
      <span class="subhead">THE ETHICS OF DESECRATION</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">With</span> the awakening of a world-wide interest in the tomb of Tutankhamen
    there has been a good deal of not altogether relevant discussion about
    the ethics of desecration, which is none the less unfortunate because
    it is inspired by ignorance of the real facts of the case. By inflaming
    feeling it may help to defeat the object everyone concerned is doing
    his utmost to achieve, that is, to secure the adequate protection and
    reverent treatment of the dead pharaoh and his fellow-sleepers. Hence
    it is necessary to put the issue in its true light.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seems to have been overlooked by those who write about leaving the
    royal mummies in their own tombs that in the past only one of them was
    actually found in his own tomb, and that this pharaoh, Amenhotep II,
    was left there reposing in his own sarcophagus. It is equally important
    to note that it was Mr Howard Carter, who is in charge of the present
    <span class="pagenum" >125</span>
    work for the late Lord Carnarvon, who was at that time Inspector of
    Antiquities at Luxor and was largely responsible for this decision. Nor
    is it any secret that those responsible for the present work propose to
    leave the mummy of Tutankhamen in the tomb, provided that the risk of
    damage can be guarded against.
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue raised by the oft-repeated protests against desecration is
    complicated by the fact that in every case the mummies of the pharaohs
    were plundered and grossly maltreated by their own subjects more than
    thirty centuries ago; and, except in two or three instances, were
    unceremoniously removed from their own tombs and hidden away in any
    place that happened to be convenient.
  </p>

  <p>
    If archæologists did not open and examine these tombs there is no doubt
    that in time the native tomb-robbers of Luxor, the most experienced
    members of their craft to be found anywhere, would in time discover the
    hidden tombs, plundering them and destroying the historical evidence.
    There can be no question that the work of the archæologist when
    conscientiously done saves the ancient tombs from wilful destruction
    and gives the mummies and the furniture a new lease of assured
    existence. So long as these tombs<span class="pagenum" >126</span>
    are left alone there is always the
    risk that they will be desecrated at any moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem which the archæologist has to solve, once he has opened
    a tomb, is what is the proper course to take with reference to the
    mummies and the funerary equipment. It is claimed by many writers to
    the Press that at any rate the bodies of the kings ought to be restored.
  </p>

  <p>
    But even if it were possible to replace the royal mummies in their
    own tombs, and to persuade the museums of the world to return their
    sarcophagi and funerary equipment, it would still be a moot point
    whether such procedures would save them from desecration. For, unless
    large sums of money are spent in equipping the tombs against the
    attacks of robbers and providing guards, such measures would defeat the
    purpose that prompted them. For the mummies would become the lure for
    the greed of the Theban population, which for sixty centuries and more
    has been habituated to tomb-robbing, and has shown little respect for
    the mummies of even the most famous of its rulers. In fact, the most
    powerful sovereigns of Egypt have suffered worst at the hands of the
    people of their own metropolis. The mummies of the greatest emperors
    and wisest<span class="pagenum" >127</span>
    statesmen of the eighteenth dynasty, such as Thothmes
    III and Amenhotep III, were stripped and badly mutilated; and it is
    more likely than not that the mummy of the famous Hatshepsut, the
    Queen Elizabeth of Egyptian history, was totally destroyed. Even when
    Amenhotep II (together with the mummies found with him) were left in
    his own tomb, it was not long before the tomb was entered by plunderers
    and wanton damage inflicted on the bodies left in it. In my volume of
    the Official Catalogue of the Cairo Museum, dealing with the royal
    mummies, gruesome evidence is given of the mutilation effected upon the
    bodies of a prince and two princesses in this tomb, both by ancient and
    modern robbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The moral of all this is that unless the tomb is rendered
    burglar-proof, and in addition is protected by adequate guards, it is
    inviting desecration to leave the mummies in them. Everyone immediately
    concerned with the problem of Tutankhamen’s mummy agrees that, if it is
    feasible, it should be left in its own tomb and adequately protected
    there after a thorough examination of it has been made, and all the
    information as to age and infirmities which the X-rays can afford has
    been obtained. The late Lord Carnarvon was strongly in favour of
    <span class="pagenum" >128</span> this
    course of action, and Mr Howard Carter has always been in favour of
    leaving the mummies in their tombs. But if this is done they must be
    adequately guarded. For it is not an exaggeration to claim that in the
    past the removal of the royal mummies to the Cairo Museum saved them
    from destruction, or from being broken up for disposal to tourists, as
    in former centuries some of them were sold to druggists. For, as Sir
    Thomas Browne expressed it two and a half centuries ago, “The Egyptian
    mummies, which Cambyses or time hath spared, avarice now consumeth.
    Mummy is become merchandise, Mizraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold
    for balsams.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But, apart from such considerations, the fact has not received due
    acknowledgment that the archæologists who are investigating the tomb
    of Tutankhamen are clearly not engaged in a work of destruction or of
    desecration, but are striving to preserve his remains and his treasured
    possessions, and to secure his name and his record from the oblivion
    which he himself and his representatives strove so hard to avert.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relatively slight disturbance of the antechamber holds out the
    prospect that the mummy also may have been spared that
    <span class="pagenum" >129</span> wanton
    destruction which was the fate of so many pharaohs of his dynasty,
    although it is to be expected that the valuable gold objects upon the
    body are not likely to have escaped the plunderers.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the mummy is found, an examination of it by means of the X-rays will
    be made; but, whatever measures are adopted for wresting from it the
    story it has to tell, no one need be anxious about its desecration.
    No damage of any sort will be inflicted upon the body; but every
    precaution will be taken to assure that prolongation of its existence
    within its own sarcophagus which the embalmer of thirty-two centuries
    ago aimed at achieving.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the commentary on the discoveries in Tutankhamen’s tomb I have dealt
    mainly with aspects of the new revelation of Egyptian customs and
    beliefs that to most readers may seem less impressive than the dazzling
    display of artistic treasures which has aroused in them an interest in
    archæology.
  </p>

  <p>
    But to the student who is interested in tracing out the origin of
    the customs and beliefs which have shaped the fabric of civilization
    and influenced the trends of even our own thoughts, the objective
    expression of ancient beliefs displayed in Tutankhamen’s tomb is
    <span class="pagenum" >130</span> the
    most important outcome of Mr Howard Carter’s discovery.
  </p>

  <p>
    For it enables us to realize more vividly than before the relentless
    and persistent logic with which the ancient Egyptian theologian strove
    by any and every device he could think of, to make as certain as any
    physical or magical procedure could make it, to give a new lease of
    life or existence to the dead. Many modern scholars object to the use
    of the word logic to apply to a series of procedures inconsistent the
    one with the other except in their ultimate aim, and are constantly
    emphasizing and marvelling at their lack of cogency and consistency.
    But the modern psychologist has recently been insisting that we
    ourselves, and, in fact, all mankind, are just as illogical as the
    Ancient Egyptian priesthood. In our everyday life we are hourly doing
    things as glaringly inconsistent the one with the other as anything
    that the Egyptians ever did. It is merely that our wider acquaintance
    with the nature of matter and the properties of living creatures
    enables us the more readily to hide our inconsistencies and rationalize
    our statements so as to hide our ignorance and lack of cogency.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this connexion it is important to try and
    <span class="pagenum" >131</span> put ourselves in the
    position of the theologians of Tutankhamen’s time, and ask whether it
    is likely that they really imagined the ceremonial couches to be potent
    to transfer the dead king to the sky. They knew perfectly well that the
    couches could not effect this physical transference to a topographical
    heaven. But long usage had accustomed them to attach a definite
    symbolic meaning to the ceremonial practice of placing the mummy of the
    king upon such couches. This was supposed to confer upon the dead king
    immortality and divinity, to identify him with the sun-god Re in the
    sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem which is perhaps responsible for most disagreement between
    Egyptian scholars to-day is the relationship of the two gods Osiris
    and Re, with both of which the dead king was identified as a means of
    attaining immortality. The obvious connecting link between them is the
    rôle assigned to Horus, who, as the son of Osiris, is charged with the
    function of securing for the dead king the same boons which he was
    able to confer on Osiris. Yet as a sun-god, intimately associated with
    Re, Horus could also secure for him the solar heaven and enable him to
    dwell with Re, if not be identified with him, in the sun.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >132</span></p>

  <p>
    There is a profound difference of opinion whether Osiris or Re was the
    earliest god. Philologists like Professor Breasted and Dr Blackman, who
    derive their knowledge from the literary texts (which, however, were
    not put into writing until all thought and expression were dominated
    by the sun-cult and the Pyramid Texts were actually written by
    Heliopolitan priests) insist on the priority of the sun-god Re.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethnologists who know how relatively recent is the belief in a
    sky-world and in sun-worship insist upon the priority of the god
    Osiris, who was originally a king on earth. To my mind the whole
    conception of deity and the attributes of the earliest gods can be
    understood and explained only if we admit that Osiris was the first god
    and that Re acquired his reputation secondarily from Osiris.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Tutankhamen’s tomb the one idea that informed the funerary ritual
    and equipment was this identification with Osiris, and the solar
    embellishments are clearly additions to the more ancient practices. I
    have entered in detail into the interesting problems of the funerary
    couches in order to bring out in a definite and concrete form the
    essential meaning of the whole equipment of Tutankhamen’s tomb.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" >133</span></p>

  <p>
    What renders the obtrusiveness of the Osirian element in Tutankhamen’s
    ritual additionally significant is the fact that he had been a
    worshipper of the sun’s disc, the Aton, and had just been converted
    to that denomination of the Re-cult which was associated with Amen.
    But although these different forms of the sun-cult were in turn his
    confessed beliefs, it is a striking demonstration of the fundamental
    nature of the Osirian cult that it dominates the ceremonies of
    Tutankhamen’s death and burial.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
